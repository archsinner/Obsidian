# OpenBSD

Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!

The OpenBSD project produces a **FREE**, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, [proactive security](https://www.openbsd.org/security.html) and [integrated cryptography](https://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html). As an example of the effect OpenBSD has, the popular [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) software comes from OpenBSD.

OpenBSD is freely available from our download sites.

The current release is [OpenBSD 7.0](https://www.openbsd.org/70.html), released Oct 14, 2021. This is the 51st release.

OpenBSD is developed entirely by volunteers. The project's development environment and [developer events](https://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html) are funded through contributions collected by [The OpenBSD Foundation](https://www.openbsdfoundation.org/). Contributions ensure that OpenBSD will remain a vibrant and [free](https://www.openbsd.org/policy.html) operating system.
