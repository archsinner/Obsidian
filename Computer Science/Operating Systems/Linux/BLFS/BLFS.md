# What is Beyond Linux From Scratch?

Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS) is a project that continues where the LFS book finishes. It assists users in developing their systems according to their needs by providing a broad range of instructions for installing and configuring various packages on top of a base LFS system.

## Why would I want a BLFS system?

If you are wondering why you would want a BLFS system or don't know what LFS is, then you don't want to be here just yet â€” you should head over to the [LFS Project Homepage](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html) where all will be explained.

## What can I do with my BLFS system?

Nearly anything! An LFS system is primed to become a system that fits whatever need you have. BLFS is the book that takes you down your own custom path. You could build an office workstation, a multimedia desktop, a router, a server, or all of the above! And the best part is you only install what you need.
