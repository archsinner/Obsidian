## 6.12. Make-4.3

The Make package contains a program for controlling the generation of executables and other non-source files of a package from source files.

**Approximate build time:**0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**15 MB

### 6.12.1. Installation of Make

Prepare Make for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr   \
            --without-guile \
            --host=$LFS_TGT \
            --build=$(build-aux/config.guess)

**The meaning of the new configure option:**

_`--without-guile`_

Although we are cross-compiling, configure tries to use guile from the build host if it finds it. This makes compilation fail, so this switch prevents using it.

Compile the package:

make

Install the package:

make DESTDIR=$LFS install
