The Bash package contains the Bourne-Again SHell.

**Approximate build time:**0.4 SBU

**Required disk space:**64 MB

### 6.4.1. Installation of Bash

Prepare Bash for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr                   \
            --build=$(support/config.guess) \
            --host=$LFS_TGT                 \
            --without-bash-malloc

**The meaning of the configure options:**

_`--without-bash-malloc`_

This option turns off the use of Bash's memory allocation (`malloc`) function which is known to cause segmentation faults. By turning this option off, Bash will use the `malloc` functions from Glibc which are more stable.

Compile the package:

make

Install the package:

make DESTDIR=$LFS install

Make a link for the programs that use **sh** for a shell:

ln -sv bash $LFS/bin/sh
