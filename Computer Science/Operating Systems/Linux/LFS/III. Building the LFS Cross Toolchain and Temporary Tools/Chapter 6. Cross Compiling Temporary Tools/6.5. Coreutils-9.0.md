## 6.5. Coreutils-9.0

The Coreutils package contains utilities for showing and setting the basic system characteristics.

**Approximate build time:**0.6 SBU

**Required disk space:**158 MB

### 6.5.1. Installation of Coreutils

Prepare Coreutils for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr                     \
            --host=$LFS_TGT                   \
            --build=$(build-aux/config.guess) \
            --enable-install-program=hostname \
            --enable-no-install-program=kill,uptime

**The meaning of the configure options:**

`--enable-install-program=hostname`

This enables the **hostname** binary to be built and installed – it is disabled by default but is required by the Perl test suite.

Compile the package:

make

Install the package:

make DESTDIR=$LFS install

Move programs to their final expected locations. Although this is not necessary in this temporary environment, we must do so because some programs harcode executable locations:

mv -v $LFS/usr/bin/chroot              $LFS/usr/sbin
mkdir -pv $LFS/usr/share/man/man8
mv -v $LFS/usr/share/man/man1/chroot.1 $LFS/usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
sed -i 's/"1"/"8"/'                    $LFS/usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
