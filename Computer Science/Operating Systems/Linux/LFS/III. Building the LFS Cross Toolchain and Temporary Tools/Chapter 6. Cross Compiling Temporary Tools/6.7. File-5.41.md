## 6.7. File-5.41

The File package contains a utility for determining the type of a given file or files.

**Approximate build time:**0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**32 MB

### 6.7.1. Installation of File

The **file** command on the build host needs to be same version as the one we are building in order to create the signature file. Run the following commands to build it:

mkdir build
pushd build
  ../configure --disable-bzlib      \
               --disable-libseccomp \
               --disable-xzlib      \
               --disable-zlib
  make
popd

**The meaning of the new configure option:**

_`--disable-*`_

The configuration script attempts to use some packages from the host distribution if the corresponding library files exist. It may cause compilation failure if a library file exists, but the corresponding header files do not. These options prevent using these unneeded capabilities from the host.

Prepare File for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr --host=$LFS_TGT --build=$(./config.guess)

Compile the package:

make FILE_COMPILE=$(pwd)/build/src/file

Install the package:

make DESTDIR=$LFS install
