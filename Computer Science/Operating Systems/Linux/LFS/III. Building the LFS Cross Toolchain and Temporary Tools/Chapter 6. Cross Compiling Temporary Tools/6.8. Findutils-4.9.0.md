## 6.8. Findutils-4.9.0

The Findutils package contains programs to find files. These programs are provided to recursively search through a directory tree and to create, maintain, and search a database (often faster than the recursive find, but is unreliable if the database has not been recently updated).

**Approximate build time:**0.2 SBU

**Required disk space:**42 MB
