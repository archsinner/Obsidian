## Chapter 7. Entering Chroot and Building Additional Temporary Tools

## 7.1. Introduction

This chapter shows how to build the last missing bits of the temporary system: the tools needed by the build machinery of various packages. Now that all circular dependencies have been resolved, a “chroot” environment, completely isolated from the host operating system (except for the running kernel), can be used for the build.

For proper operation of the isolated environment, some communication with the running kernel must be established. This is done through the so-called _Virtual Kernel File Systems_, which must be mounted when entering the chroot environment. You may want to check that they are mounted by issuing **findmnt**.

Until [Section 7.4, “Entering the Chroot Environment”](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#ch-tools-chroot "7.4. Entering the Chroot Environment"), the commands must be run as `root`, with the `LFS` variable set. After entering chroot, all commands are run as root, fortunately without access to the OS of the computer you built LFS on. Be careful anyway, as it is easy to destroy the whole LFS system with badly formed commands.
