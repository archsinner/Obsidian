## 7.8. Gettext-0.21

The Gettext package contains utilities for internationalization and localization. These allow programs to be compiled with NLS (Native Language Support), enabling them to output messages in the user's native language.

**Approximate build time:**1.6 SBU

**Required disk space:**280 MB

### 7.8.1. Installation of Gettext

For our temporary set of tools, we only need to install three programs from Gettext.

Prepare Gettext for compilation:

./configure --disable-shared

**The meaning of the configure option:**

_`--disable-shared`_

We do not need to install any of the shared Gettext libraries at this time, therefore there is no need to build them.

Compile the package:

make

Install the **msgfmt**, **msgmerge**, and **xgettext** programs:

cp -v gettext-tools/src/{msgfmt,msgmerge,xgettext} /usr/bin
