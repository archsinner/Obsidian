## 11.4. What Now?

Thank you for reading this LFS book. We hope that you have found this book helpful and have learned more about the system creation process.

Now that the LFS system is installed, you may be wondering “What next?” To answer that question, we have compiled a list of resources for you.

-   Maintenance
    
    Bugs and security notices are reported regularly for all software. Since an LFS system is compiled from source, it is up to you to keep abreast of such reports. There are several online resources that track such reports, some of which are shown below:
    
    -   [CERT](http://www.cert.org/) (Computer Emergency Response Team)
        
        CERT has a mailing list that publishes security alerts concerning various operating systems and applications. Subscription information is available at [http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/signup.html](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/signup.html).
        
    -   Bugtraq
        
        Bugtraq is a full-disclosure computer security mailing list. It publishes newly discovered security issues, and occasionally potential fixes for them. Subscription information is available at [http://www.securityfocus.com/archive](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive).
        
    
-   Beyond Linux From Scratch
    
    The Beyond Linux From Scratch book covers installation procedures for a wide range of software beyond the scope of the LFS Book. The BLFS project is located at [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/).
    
-   LFS Hints
    
    The LFS Hints are a collection of educational documents submitted by volunteers in the LFS community. The hints are available at [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/).
    
-   Mailing lists
    
    There are several LFS mailing lists you may subscribe to if you are in need of help, want to stay current with the latest developments, want to contribute to the project, and more. See [Chapter 1 - Mailing Lists](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#ch-intro-maillists "1.4.2. Mailing Lists") for more information.
    
-   The Linux Documentation Project
    
    The goal of The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP) is to collaborate on all of the issues of Linux documentation. The TLDP features a large collection of HOWTOs, guides, and man pages. It is located at [http://www.tldp.org/](http://www.tldp.org/).
