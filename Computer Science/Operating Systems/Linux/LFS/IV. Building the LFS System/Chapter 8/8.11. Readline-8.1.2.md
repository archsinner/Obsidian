## 8.11.Â Readline-8.1.2

The Readline package is a set of libraries that offers command-line editing and history capabilities.

**Approximate build time:**0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**15 MB

### 8.11.1. Installation of Readline

Reinstalling Readline will cause the old libraries to be moved to <libraryname>.old. While this is normally not a problem, in some cases it can trigger a linking bug in **ldconfig**. This can be avoided by issuing the following two seds:

sed -i '/MV.*old/d' Makefile.in
sed -i '/{OLDSUFF}/c:' support/shlib-install

Prepare Readline for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr    \
            --disable-static \
            --with-curses    \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/readline-8.1.2

**The meaning of the configure option:**

_`--with-curses`_

This option tells Readline that it can find the termcap library functions in the curses library, rather than a separate termcap library. It allows generating a correct `readline.pc` file.

Compile the package:

make SHLIB_LIBS="-lncursesw"

**The meaning of the make option:**

_`SHLIB_LIBS="-lncursesw"`_

This option forces Readline to link against the `libncursesw` library.

This package does not come with a test suite.

Install the package:

make SHLIB_LIBS="-lncursesw" install

If desired, install the documentation:

install -v -m644 doc/*.{ps,pdf,html,dvi} /usr/share/doc/readline-8.1.2
