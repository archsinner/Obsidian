## 8.16.Â Expect-5.45.4

The Expect package contains tools for automating, via scripted dialogues, interactive applications such as **telnet**, **ftp**, **passwd**, **fsck**, **rlogin**, and **tip**. Expect is also useful for testing these same applications as well as easing all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively difficult with anything else. The DejaGnu framework is written in Expect.

**Approximate build time:**0.2 SBU

**Required disk space:**3.9 MB

### 8.16.1. Installation of Expect

Prepare Expect for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr           \
            --with-tcl=/usr/lib     \
            --enable-shared         \
            --mandir=/usr/share/man \
            --with-tclinclude=/usr/include

**The meaning of the configure options:**

_`--with-tcl=/usr/lib`_

This parameter is needed to tell **configure** where the **tclConfig.sh** script is located.

_`--with-tclinclude=/usr/include`_

This explicitly tells Expect where to find Tcl's internal headers.

Build the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make test

Install the package:

make install
ln -svf expect5.45.4/libexpect5.45.4.so /usr/lib
