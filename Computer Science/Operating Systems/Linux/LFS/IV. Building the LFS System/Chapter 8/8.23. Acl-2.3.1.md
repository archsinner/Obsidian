### 8.23.1. Installation of Acl

Prepare Acl for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr         \
            --disable-static      \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/acl-2.3.1

Compile the package:

make

The Acl tests need to be run on a filesystem that supports access controls after Coreutils has been built with the Acl libraries. If desired, return to this package and run **make check** after Coreutils has been built later in this chapter.

Install the package:

make install
