**Approximate build time:**less than 0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**2.7 MB

### 8.24.1. Installation of Libcap

Prevent static libraries from being installed:

sed -i '/install -m.*STA/d' libcap/Makefile

Compile the package:

make prefix=/usr lib=lib

**The meaning of the make option:**

_`lib=lib`_

This parameter sets the library directory to `/usr/lib` rather than `/usr/lib64` on x86_64. It has no effect on x86.

To test the results, issue:

make test

Install the package:

make prefix=/usr lib=lib install
