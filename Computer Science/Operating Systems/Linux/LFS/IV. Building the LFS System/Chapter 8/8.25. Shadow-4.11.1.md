## 8.25. Shadow-4.11.1

The Shadow package contains programs for handling passwords in a secure way.

**Approximate build time:**0.2 SBU

**Required disk space:**49 MB

### 8.25.1. Installation of Shadow

### Note

If you would like to enforce the use of strong passwords, refer to [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/postlfs/cracklib.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/postlfs/cracklib.html) for installing CrackLib prior to building Shadow. Then add _`--with-libcrack`_ to the **configure** command below.

Disable the installation of the **groups** program and its man pages, as Coreutils provides a better version. Also, prevent the installation of manual pages that were already installed in [Section 8.3, “Man-pages-5.13”](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#ch-system-man-pages "8.3. Man-pages-5.13"):

sed -i 's/groups$(EXEEXT) //' src/Makefile.in
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/groups\.1 / /'   {} \;
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/getspnam\.3 / /' {} \;
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/passwd\.5 / /'   {} \;

Instead of using the default _crypt_ method, use the more secure _SHA-512_ method of password encryption, which also allows passwords longer than 8 characters. It is also necessary to change the obsolete `/var/spool/mail` location for user mailboxes that Shadow uses by default to the `/var/mail` location used currently. And, get rid of `/bin` and `/sbin` from `PATH`, since they are simply symlinks to their counterpart in `/usr`.

### Note

If `/bin` and/or `/sbin` are preferred to be left over in `PATH` for some reason, modify `PATH` in `.bashrc` after LFS is built.

sed -e 's:#ENCRYPT_METHOD DES:ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512:' \
    -e 's:/var/spool/mail:/var/mail:'                 \
    -e '/PATH=/{s@/sbin:@@;s@/bin:@@}'                \
    -i etc/login.defs

### Note

If you chose to build Shadow with Cracklib support, run the following:

sed -i 's:DICTPATH.*:DICTPATH\t/lib/cracklib/pw_dict:' etc/login.defs

Prepare Shadow for compilation:

touch /usr/bin/passwd
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc \
            --disable-static  \
            --with-group-name-max-length=32

**The meaning of the configure option:**

**touch /usr/bin/passwd**

The file `/usr/bin/passwd` needs to exist because its location is hardcoded in some programs, and if it does not exist, the default location is not right.

_`--with-group-name-max-length=32`_

The maximum user name is 32 characters. Make the maximum group name the same.

Compile the package:

make

This package does not come with a test suite.

Install the package:

make exec_prefix=/usr install
make -C man install-man

### 8.25.2. Configuring Shadow

This package contains utilities to add, modify, and delete users and groups; set and change their passwords; and perform other administrative tasks. For a full explanation of what _password shadowing_ means, see the `doc/HOWTO` file within the unpacked source tree. If using Shadow support, keep in mind that programs which need to verify passwords (display managers, FTP programs, pop3 daemons, etc.) must be Shadow-compliant. That is, they need to be able to work with shadowed passwords.

To enable shadowed passwords, run the following command:

pwconv

To enable shadowed group passwords, run:

grpconv

Shadow's default configuration for the **useradd** utility has a few caveats that need some explanation. First, the default action for the **useradd** utility is to create the user and a group of the same name as the user. By default the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) numbers will begin with 1000. This means if you don't pass parameters to **useradd**, each user will be a member of a unique group on the system. If this behavior is undesirable, you'll need to pass one of the _`-g`_ or _`-N`_ parameter to **useradd** or to change the setting of _`USERGROUPS_ENAB`_ in `/etc/login.defs`. See `useradd(8)` for more information.

Second, to change the default parameters, the file `/etc/default/useradd` needs to be created and tailored to suit your particular needs. Create it with:

mkdir -p /etc/default
useradd -D --gid 999

**`/etc/default/useradd` Parameter Explanations**

_`GROUP=999`_

This parameter sets the beginning of the group numbers used in the `/etc/group` file. The particular value 999 comes from the _`--gid`_ parameter above. You can modify it to anything you desire. Note that **useradd** will never reuse a UID or GID. If the number identified in this parameter is used, it will use the next available number. Note also that if you don't have a group with an ID equal to this number on your system the first time you use **useradd** without the _`-g`_ parameter, you will get a message displayed on the terminal that says: `useradd: unknown GID 999`, although the account is correctly created. That is why we have created the group `users` with this group ID in [Section 7.6, “Creating Essential Files and Symlinks”](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#ch-tools-createfiles "7.6. Creating Essential Files and Symlinks").

_`CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes`_

This parameter causes **useradd** to create a mailbox file for the newly created user. **useradd** will make the group ownership of this file to the `mail` group with 0660 permissions. If you would prefer that these mailbox files are not created by **useradd**, issue the following command:

sed -i '/MAIL/s/yes/no/' /etc/default/useradd

### 8.25.3. Setting the root password

Choose a password for user _root_ and set it by running:

passwd root
