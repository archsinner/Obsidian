## 8.28.Â Ncurses-6.3

The Ncurses package contains libraries for terminal-independent handling of character screens.

**Approximate build time:**0.4 SBU

**Required disk space:**45 MB

### 8.28.1. Installation of Ncurses

Prepare Ncurses for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr           \
            --mandir=/usr/share/man \
            --with-shared           \
            --without-debug         \
            --without-normal        \
            --enable-pc-files       \
            --enable-widec          \
            --with-pkg-config-libdir=/usr/lib/pkgconfig

**The meaning of the new configure options:**

_`--enable-widec`_

This switch causes wide-character libraries (e.g., `libncursesw.so.6.3`) to be built instead of normal ones (e.g., `libncurses.so.6.3`). These wide-character libraries are usable in both multibyte and traditional 8-bit locales, while normal libraries work properly only in 8-bit locales. Wide-character and normal libraries are source-compatible, but not binary-compatible.

_`--enable-pc-files`_

This switch generates and installs .pc files for pkg-config.

_`--without-normal`_

This switch disables building and installing most static libraries.

Compile the package:

make

This package has a test suite, but it can only be run after the package has been installed. The tests reside in the `test/` directory. See the `README` file in that directory for further details.

The installation of this package will overwrite `libncursesw.so.6.3` in-place. It may crash the shell process which is using code and data from the library file. Install the package with `DESTDIR`, and replace the library file correctly using **install** command. A useless static archive which is not handled by **configure** is also removed:

make DESTDIR=$PWD/dest install
install -vm755 dest/usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6.3 /usr/lib
rm -v  dest/usr/lib/{libncursesw.so.6.3,libncurses++w.a}
cp -av dest/* /

Many applications still expect the linker to be able to find non-wide-character Ncurses libraries. Trick such applications into linking with wide-character libraries by means of symlinks and linker scripts:

for lib in ncurses form panel menu ; do
    rm -vf                    /usr/lib/lib${lib}.so
    echo "INPUT(-l${lib}w)" > /usr/lib/lib${lib}.so
    ln -sfv ${lib}w.pc        /usr/lib/pkgconfig/${lib}.pc
done

Finally, make sure that old applications that look for `-lcurses` at build time are still buildable:

rm -vf                     /usr/lib/libcursesw.so
echo "INPUT(-lncursesw)" > /usr/lib/libcursesw.so
ln -sfv libncurses.so      /usr/lib/libcurses.so

If desired, install the Ncurses documentation:

mkdir -pv      /usr/share/doc/ncurses-6.3
cp -v -R doc/* /usr/share/doc/ncurses-6.3

### Note

The instructions above don't create non-wide-character Ncurses libraries since no package installed by compiling from sources would link against them at runtime. However, the only known binary-only applications that link against non-wide-character Ncurses libraries require version 5. If you must have such libraries because of some binary-only application or to be compliant with LSB, build the package again with the following commands:

make distclean
./configure --prefix=/usr    \
            --with-shared    \
            --without-normal \
            --without-debug  \
            --without-cxx-binding \
            --with-abi-version=5
make sources libs
cp -av lib/lib*.so.5* /usr/lib

### 8.28.2. Contents of Ncurses

**Installed programs:**captoinfo (link to tic), clear, infocmp, infotocap (link to tic), ncursesw6-config, reset (link to tset), tabs, tic, toe, tput, and tset

**Installed libraries:**libcursesw.so (symlink and linker script to libncursesw.so), libformw.so, libmenuw.so, libncursesw.so, libpanelw.so, and their non-wide-character counterparts without "w" in the library names.

**Installed directories:**/usr/share/tabset, /usr/share/terminfo, and /usr/share/doc/ncurses-6.3

#### Short Descriptions

**captoinfo**

Converts a termcap description into a terminfo description

**clear**

Clears the screen, if possible

**infocmp**

Compares or prints out terminfo descriptions

**infotocap**

Converts a terminfo description into a termcap description

**ncursesw6-config**

Provides configuration information for ncurses

**reset**

Reinitializes a terminal to its default values

**tabs**

Clears and sets tab stops on a terminal

**tic**

The terminfo entry-description compiler that translates a terminfo file from source format into the binary format needed for the ncurses library routines [A terminfo file contains information on the capabilities of a certain terminal.]

**toe**

Lists all available terminal types, giving the primary name and description for each

**tput**

Makes the values of terminal-dependent capabilities available to the shell; it can also be used to reset or initialize a terminal or report its long name

**tset**

Can be used to initialize terminals

`libcursesw`

A link to `libncursesw`

`libncursesw`

Contains functions to display text in many complex ways on a terminal screen; a good example of the use of these functions is the menu displayed during the kernel's **make menuconfig**

`libformw`

Contains functions to implement forms

`libmenuw`

Contains functions to implement menus

`libpanelw`

Contains functions to implement panels
