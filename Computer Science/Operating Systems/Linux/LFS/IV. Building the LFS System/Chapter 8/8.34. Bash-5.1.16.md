## 8.34. Bash-5.1.16

The Bash package contains the Bourne-Again SHell.

**Approximate build time:**1.5 SBU

**Required disk space:**50 MB

### 8.34.1. Installation of Bash

Prepare Bash for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr                      \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/bash-5.1.16 \
            --without-bash-malloc              \
            --with-installed-readline

**The meaning of the new configure option:**

_`--with-installed-readline`_

This option tells Bash to use the `readline` library that is already installed on the system rather than using its own readline version.

Compile the package:

make

Skip down to “Install the package” if not running the test suite.

To prepare the tests, ensure that the `tester` user can write to the sources tree:

chown -Rv tester .

The testsuite of the package is designed to be run as a non-root user that owns the terminal connected to standard input. To satisfy the requirement, spawn a new pseudo terminal using Expect and run the tests as the `tester` user:

su -s /usr/bin/expect tester << EOF
set timeout -1
spawn make tests
expect eof
lassign [wait] _ _ _ value
exit $value
EOF

Install the package:

make install

Run the newly compiled **bash** program (replacing the one that is currently being executed):

exec /usr/bin/bash --login

#### Short Descriptions

**bash**

A widely-used command interpreter; it performs many types of expansions and substitutions on a given command line before executing it, thus making this interpreter a powerful tool

**bashbug**

A shell script to help the user compose and mail standard formatted bug reports concerning **bash**

**sh**

A symlink to the **bash** program; when invoked as **sh**, **bash** tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of **sh** as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well
