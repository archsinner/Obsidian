## 8.35.Â Libtool-2.4.6

The Libtool package contains the GNU generic library support script. It wraps the complexity of using shared libraries in a consistent, portable interface.

**Approximate build time:**1.5 SBU

**Required disk space:**43 MB

### 8.35.1. Installation of Libtool

Prepare Libtool for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make check

### Note

The test time for libtool can be reduced significantly on a system with multiple cores. To do this, append **TESTSUITEFLAGS=-j<N>** to the line above. For instance, using -j4 can reduce the test time by over 60 percent.

Five tests are known to fail in the LFS build environment due to a circular dependency, but all tests pass if rechecked after automake is installed.

Install the package:

make install

Remove a useless static library:

rm -fv /usr/lib/libltdl.a
