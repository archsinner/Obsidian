## 8.36.Â GDBM-1.23

The GDBM package contains the GNU Database Manager. It is a library of database functions that use extensible hashing and works similar to the standard UNIX dbm. The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs, searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key along with its data.

**Approximate build time:**0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**13 MB

### 8.36.1. Installation of GDBM

Prepare GDBM for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr    \
            --disable-static \
            --enable-libgdbm-compat

**The meaning of the configure option:**

`--enable-libgdbm-compat`

This switch enables building the libgdbm compatibility library. Some packages outside of LFS may require the older DBM routines it provides.

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make check

Install the package:

make install
