## 8.41. Perl-5.34.0

The Perl package contains the Practical Extraction and Report Language.

**Approximate build time:**9.3 SBU

**Required disk space:**226 MB

### 8.41.1. Installation of Perl

First, apply a patch that fixes an issue highlighted by recent versions of gdbm:

patch -Np1 -i ../perl-5.34.0-upstream_fixes-1.patch

This version of Perl now builds the Compress::Raw::Zlib and Compress::Raw::BZip2 modules. By default Perl will use an internal copy of the sources for the build. Issue the following command so that Perl will use the libraries installed on the system:

export BUILD_ZLIB=False
export BUILD_BZIP2=0

To have full control over the way Perl is set up, you can remove the “-des” options from the following command and hand-pick the way this package is built. Alternatively, use the command exactly as below to use the defaults that Perl auto-detects:

sh Configure -des                                         \
             -Dprefix=/usr                                \
             -Dvendorprefix=/usr                          \
             -Dprivlib=/usr/lib/perl5/5.34/core_perl      \
             -Darchlib=/usr/lib/perl5/5.34/core_perl      \
             -Dsitelib=/usr/lib/perl5/5.34/site_perl      \
             -Dsitearch=/usr/lib/perl5/5.34/site_perl     \
             -Dvendorlib=/usr/lib/perl5/5.34/vendor_perl  \
             -Dvendorarch=/usr/lib/perl5/5.34/vendor_perl \
             -Dman1dir=/usr/share/man/man1                \
             -Dman3dir=/usr/share/man/man3                \
             -Dpager="/usr/bin/less -isR"                 \
             -Duseshrplib                                 \
             -Dusethreads

**The meaning of the configure options:**

_`-Dvendorprefix=/usr`_

This ensures **perl** knows how to tell packages where they should install their perl modules.

_`-Dpager="/usr/bin/less -isR"`_

This ensures that **`less`** is used instead of **`more`**.

_`-Dman1dir=/usr/share/man/man1 -Dman3dir=/usr/share/man/man3`_

Since Groff is not installed yet, **Configure** thinks that we do not want man pages for Perl. Issuing these parameters overrides this decision.

_`-Duseshrplib`_

Build a shared libperl needed by some perl modules.

_`-Dusethreads`_

Build perl with support for threads.

_`-Dprivlib,-Darchlib,-Dsitelib,...`_

These settings define where Perl is looking for installed modules. The LFS editors chose to put them in a directory structure based on the Major.Minor version of Perl (5.34) which allows upgrading Perl to newer Patch levels (5.34.0) without the need to reinstall all of the modules again.

Compile the package:

make

To test the results (approximately 11 SBU), issue:

make test

Install the package and clean up:

make install
unset BUILD_ZLIB BUILD_BZIP2
