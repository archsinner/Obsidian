## 8.44. Autoconf-2.71

The Autoconf package contains programs for producing shell scripts that can automatically configure source code.

**Approximate build time:**less than 0.1 SBU (about 6.8 SBU with tests)

**Required disk space:**24 MB

### 8.44.1. Installation of Autoconf

Prepare Autoconf for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make check

### Note

The test time for autoconf can be reduced significantly on a system with multiple cores. To do this, append **TESTSUITEFLAGS=-j<N>** to the line above. For instance, using -j4 can reduce the test time by over 60 percent.

Install the package:

make install

### 8.44.2. Contents of Autoconf

**Installed programs:**autoconf, autoheader, autom4te, autoreconf, autoscan, autoupdate, and ifnames

**Installed directory:**/usr/share/autoconf

#### Short Descriptions

**autoconf**

Produces shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Unix-like systems; the configuration scripts it produces are independent—running them does not require the **autoconf** program

**autoheader**

A tool for creating template files of C _#define_ statements for configure to use

**autom4te**

A wrapper for the M4 macro processor

**autoreconf**

Automatically runs **autoconf**, **autoheader**, **aclocal**, **automake**, **gettextize**, and **libtoolize** in the correct order to save time when changes are made to **autoconf** and **automake** template files

**autoscan**

Helps to create a `configure.in` file for a software package; it examines the source files in a directory tree, searching them for common portability issues, and creates a `configure.scan` file that serves as as a preliminary `configure.in` file for the package

**autoupdate**

Modifies a `configure.in` file that still calls **autoconf** macros by their old names to use the current macro names

**ifnames**

Helps when writing `configure.in` files for a software package; it prints the identifiers that the package uses in C preprocessor conditionals [If a package has already been set up to have some portability, this program can help determine what **configure** needs to check for. It can also fill in gaps in a `configure.in` file generated by **autoscan**.]
