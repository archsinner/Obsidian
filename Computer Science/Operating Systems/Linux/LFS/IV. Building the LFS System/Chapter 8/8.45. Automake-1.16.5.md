## 8.45.Â Automake-1.16.5

The Automake package contains programs for generating Makefiles for use with Autoconf.

**Approximate build time:**less than 0.1 SBU (about 8.3 SBU with tests)

**Required disk space:**115 MB

### 8.45.1. Installation of Automake

Prepare Automake for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr --docdir=/usr/share/doc/automake-1.16.5

Compile the package:

make

Using the -j4 make option speeds up the tests, even on systems with only one processor, due to internal delays in individual tests. To test the results, issue:

make -j4 check

The test t/subobj.sh is known to fail.

Install the package:

make install
