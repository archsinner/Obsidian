### Tip

This section is not strictly required for LFS if not using systemd. On the other hand, meson/ninja is a powerful build system, which is expected to be used more and more often. It is required for several packages in [the BLFS book](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/).

### 8.52.1. Installation of Meson

Compile Meson with the following command:

python3 setup.py build

This package does not come with a test suite.

Install the package:

python3 setup.py install --root=dest
cp -rv dest/* /
install -vDm644 data/shell-completions/bash/meson /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/meson
install -vDm644 data/shell-completions/zsh/_meson /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_meson

**The meaning of the install parameters:**

_`--root=dest`_

By default **python3 setup.py install** installs various files (such as man pages) into Python Eggs. With a specified root location, **setup.py** installs these files into a standard hierarchy. Then the hierarchy can just be copied to the standard location.
