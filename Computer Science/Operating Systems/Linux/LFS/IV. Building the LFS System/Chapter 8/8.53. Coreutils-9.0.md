## 8.53. Coreutils-9.0

The Coreutils package contains utilities for showing and setting the basic system characteristics.

**Approximate build time:**2.6 SBU

**Required disk space:**153 MB

### 8.53.1. Installation of Coreutils

POSIX requires that programs from Coreutils recognize character boundaries correctly even in multibyte locales. The following patch fixes this non-compliance and other internationalization-related bugs.

patch -Np1 -i ../coreutils-9.0-i18n-1.patch

### Note

In the past, many bugs were found in this patch. When reporting new bugs to Coreutils maintainers, please check first if they are reproducible without this patch.

Now, fix a problem with chmod return values:

patch -Np1 -i ../coreutils-9.0-chmod_fix-1.patch

Now prepare Coreutils for compilation:

autoreconf -fiv
FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1 ./configure \
            --prefix=/usr            \
            --enable-no-install-program=kill,uptime

**The meaning of the configure options:**

**autoreconf**

The patch for internationalization has modified the building system of the package, so the configuration files have to be regenerated.

`FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1`

This environment variable allows the package to be built as the `root` user.

_`--enable-no-install-program=kill,uptime`_

The purpose of this switch is to prevent Coreutils from installing binaries that will be installed by other packages later.

Compile the package:

make

Skip down to “Install the package” if not running the test suite.

Now the test suite is ready to be run. First, run the tests that are meant to be run as user `root`:

make NON_ROOT_USERNAME=tester check-root

We're going to run the remainder of the tests as the `tester` user. Certain tests require that the user be a member of more than one group. So that these tests are not skipped, add a temporary group and make the user `tester` a part of it:

echo "dummy:x:102:tester" >> /etc/group

Fix some of the permissions so that the non-root user can compile and run the tests:

chown -Rv tester . 

Now run the tests:

su tester -c "PATH=$PATH make RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check"

The test-getlogin test is known to fail in the LFS chroot environment.

Remove the temporary group:

sed -i '/dummy/d' /etc/group

Install the package:

make install

Move programs to the locations specified by the FHS:

mv -v /usr/bin/chroot /usr/sbin
mv -v /usr/share/man/man1/chroot.1 /usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
sed -i 's/"1"/"8"/' /usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
