## 8.57.Â Findutils-4.9.0

The Findutils package contains programs to find files. These programs are provided to recursively search through a directory tree and to create, maintain, and search a database (often faster than the recursive find, but is unreliable if the database has not been recently updated).

**Approximate build time:**0.9 SBU

**Required disk space:**51 MB

### 8.57.1. Installation of Findutils

Prepare Findutils for compilation:

case $(uname -m) in
    i?86)   TIME_T_32_BIT_OK=yes ./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var/lib/locate ;;
    x86_64) ./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var/lib/locate ;;
esac

**The meaning of the configure options:**

**TIME_32_BIT_OK=yes**

This setting is needed for building on a 32 bit system.

_`--localstatedir`_

This option changes the location of the **locate** database to be in `/var/lib/locate`, which is FHS-compliant.

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

chown -Rv tester .
su tester -c "PATH=$PATH make check"

Install the package:

make install
