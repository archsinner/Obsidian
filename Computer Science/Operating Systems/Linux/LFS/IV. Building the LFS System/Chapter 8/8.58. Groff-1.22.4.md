## 8.58. Groff-1.22.4

The Groff package contains programs for processing and formatting text.

**Approximate build time:**0.5 SBU

**Required disk space:**88 MB

### 8.58.1. Installation of Groff

Groff expects the environment variable `PAGE` to contain the default paper size. For users in the United States, _`PAGE=letter`_ is appropriate. Elsewhere, _`PAGE=A4`_ may be more suitable. While the default paper size is configured during compilation, it can be overridden later by echoing either “A4” or “letter” to the `/etc/papersize` file.

Prepare Groff for compilation:

PAGE=_`<paper_size>`_ ./configure --prefix=/usr

This package does not support parallel build. Compile the package:

make -j1

This package does not come with a test suite.

Install the package:

make install
