## 8.59. GRUB-2.06

The GRUB package contains the GRand Unified Bootloader.

**Approximate build time:**0.7 SBU

**Required disk space:**158 MB

### 8.59.1. Installation of GRUB

### Note

If your system has UEFI support and you wish to boot LFS with UEFI, you can skip this package in LFS, and install GRUB with UEFI support (and its dependencies) following [the BLFS page](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/postlfs/grub-efi.html) at the end of this chapter.

Prepare GRUB for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr          \
            --sysconfdir=/etc      \
            --disable-efiemu       \
            --disable-werror

**The meaning of the new configure options:**

_`--disable-werror`_

This allows the build to complete with warnings introduced by more recent Flex versions.

_`--disable-efiemu`_

This option minimizes what is built by disabling a feature and testing programs not needed for LFS.

Compile the package:

make

The test suite for this packages is not recommended. Most of the tests depend on packages that are not available in the limited LFS environment. To run the tests anyway, run **make check**.

Install the package:

make install
mv -v /etc/bash_completion.d/grub /usr/share/bash-completion/completions

Using GRUB to make your LFS system bootable will be discussed in [Section 10.4, “Using GRUB to Set Up the Boot Process”](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#ch-bootable-grub "10.4. Using GRUB to Set Up the Boot Process").
