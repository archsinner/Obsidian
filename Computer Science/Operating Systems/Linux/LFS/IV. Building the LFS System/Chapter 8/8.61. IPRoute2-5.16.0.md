## 8.61.Â IPRoute2-5.16.0

The IPRoute2 package contains programs for basic and advanced IPV4-based networking.

**Approximate build time:**0.2 SBU

**Required disk space:**15 MB

### 8.61.1. Installation of IPRoute2

The **arpd** program included in this package will not be built since it is dependent on Berkeley DB, which is not installed in LFS. However, a directory for **arpd** and a man page will still be installed. Prevent this by running the commands below. If the **arpd** binary is needed, instructions for compiling Berkeley DB can be found in the BLFS Book at [https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/server/db.html](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/server/db.html).

sed -i /ARPD/d Makefile
rm -fv man/man8/arpd.8

Compile the package:

make

This package does not have a working test suite.

Install the package:

make SBINDIR=/usr/sbin install

If desired, install the documentation:

mkdir -pv             /usr/share/doc/iproute2-5.16.0
cp -v COPYING README* /usr/share/doc/iproute2-5.16.0

### 8.61.2. Contents of IPRoute2

**Installed directories:**/etc/iproute2, /usr/lib/tc, and /usr/share/doc/iproute2-5.16.0

#### Short Descriptions

**bridge**

Configures network bridges

**ctstat**

Connection status utility

**genl**

Generic netlink utility frontend

**ifcfg**

A shell script wrapper for the **ip** command [Note that it requires the **arping** and **rdisk** programs from the iputils package found at [http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/](http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/).]

**ifstat**

Shows the interface statistics, including the amount of transmitted and received packets by interface

**ip**

The main executable. It has several different functions:

**ip link _`<device>`_** allows users to look at the state of devices and to make changes

**ip addr** allows users to look at addresses and their properties, add new addresses, and delete old ones

**ip neighbor** allows users to look at neighbor bindings and their properties, add new neighbor entries, and delete old ones

**ip rule** allows users to look at the routing policies and change them

**ip route** allows users to look at the routing table and change routing table rules

**ip tunnel** allows users to look at the IP tunnels and their properties, and change them

**ip maddr** allows users to look at the multicast addresses and their properties, and change them

**ip mroute** allows users to set, change, or delete the multicast routing

**ip monitor** allows users to continuously monitor the state of devices, addresses and routes

**lnstat**

Provides Linux network statistics; it is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old **rtstat** program

**nstat**

Shows network statistics

**routef**

A component of **ip route**. This is for flushing the routing tables

**routel**

A component of **ip route**. This is for listing the routing tables

**rtacct**

Displays the contents of `/proc/net/rt_acct`

**rtmon**

Route monitoring utility

**rtpr**

Converts the output of **ip -o** back into a readable form

**rtstat**

Route status utility

**ss**

Similar to the **netstat** command; shows active connections

**tc**

Traffic Controlling Executable; this is for Quality Of Service (QOS) and Class Of Service (COS) implementations

**tc qdisc** allows users to setup the queueing discipline

**tc class** allows users to setup classes based on the queuing discipline scheduling

**tc estimator** allows users to estimate the network flow into a network

**tc filter** allows users to setup the QOS/COS packet filtering

**tc policy** allows users to setup the QOS/COS policies
