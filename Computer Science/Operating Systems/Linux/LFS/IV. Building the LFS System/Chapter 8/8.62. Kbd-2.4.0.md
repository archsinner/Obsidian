## 8.62. Kbd-2.4.0

The Kbd package contains key-table files, console fonts, and keyboard utilities.

**Approximate build time:**0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**33 MB

### 8.62.1. Installation of Kbd

The behaviour of the backspace and delete keys is not consistent across the keymaps in the Kbd package. The following patch fixes this issue for i386 keymaps:

patch -Np1 -i ../kbd-2.4.0-backspace-1.patch

After patching, the backspace key generates the character with code 127, and the delete key generates a well-known escape sequence.

Remove the redundant **resizecons** program (it requires the defunct svgalib to provide the video mode files - for normal use **setfont** sizes the console appropriately) together with its manpage.

sed -i '/RESIZECONS_PROGS=/s/yes/no/' configure
sed -i 's/resizecons.8 //' docs/man/man8/Makefile.in

Prepare Kbd for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-vlock

**The meaning of the configure option:**

_`--disable-vlock`_

This option prevents the vlock utility from being built because it requires the PAM library, which isn't available in the chroot environment.

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make check

Install the package:

make install

### Note

For some languages (e.g., Belarusian) the Kbd package doesn't provide a useful keymap where the stock “by” keymap assumes the ISO-8859-5 encoding, and the CP1251 keymap is normally used. Users of such languages have to download working keymaps separately.

If desired, install the documentation:

mkdir -pv           /usr/share/doc/kbd-2.4.0
cp -R -v docs/doc/* /usr/share/doc/kbd-2.4.0

#### Short Descriptions

**chvt**

Changes the foreground virtual terminal

**deallocvt**

Deallocates unused virtual terminals

**dumpkeys**

Dumps the keyboard translation tables

**fgconsole**

Prints the number of the active virtual terminal

**getkeycodes**

Prints the kernel scancode-to-keycode mapping table

**kbdinfo**

Obtains information about the status of a console

**kbd_mode**

Reports or sets the keyboard mode

**kbdrate**

Sets the keyboard repeat and delay rates

**loadkeys**

Loads the keyboard translation tables

**loadunimap**

Loads the kernel unicode-to-font mapping table

**mapscrn**

An obsolete program that used to load a user-defined output character mapping table into the console driver; this is now done by **setfont**

**openvt**

Starts a program on a new virtual terminal (VT)

**psfaddtable**

Adds a Unicode character table to a console font

**psfgettable**

Extracts the embedded Unicode character table from a console font

**psfstriptable**

Removes the embedded Unicode character table from a console font

**psfxtable**

Handles Unicode character tables for console fonts

**setfont**

Changes the Enhanced Graphic Adapter (EGA) and Video Graphics Array (VGA) fonts on the console

**setkeycodes**

Loads kernel scancode-to-keycode mapping table entries; this is useful if there are unusual keys on the keyboard

**setleds**

Sets the keyboard flags and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)

**setmetamode**

Defines the keyboard meta-key handling

**setvtrgb**

Sets the console color map in all virtual terminals

**showconsolefont**

Shows the current EGA/VGA console screen font

**showkey**

Reports the scancodes, keycodes, and ASCII codes of the keys pressed on the keyboard

**unicode_start**

Puts the keyboard and console in UNICODE mode [Don't use this program unless your keymap file is in the ISO-8859-1 encoding. For other encodings, this utility produces incorrect results.]

**unicode_stop**

Reverts keyboard and console from UNICODE mode
