## 8.66.Â Tar-1.34

The Tar package provides the ability to create tar archives as well as perform various other kinds of archive manipulation. Tar can be used on previously created archives to extract files, to store additional files, or to update or list files which were already stored.

**Approximate build time:**1.7 SBU

**Required disk space:**40 MB

### 8.66.1. Installation of Tar

Prepare Tar for compilation:

FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1  \
./configure --prefix=/usr

**The meaning of the configure option:**

`FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1`

This forces the test for `mknod` to be run as `root`. It is generally considered dangerous to run this test as the `root` user, but as it is being run on a system that has only been partially built, overriding it is OK.

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make check

One test, capabilities: binary store/restore, is known to fail if it is run (LFS lacks selinux), but will be skipped if the host kernel does not support extended attributes on the filesystem used for building LFS.

Install the package:

make install
make -C doc install-html docdir=/usr/share/doc/tar-1.34
