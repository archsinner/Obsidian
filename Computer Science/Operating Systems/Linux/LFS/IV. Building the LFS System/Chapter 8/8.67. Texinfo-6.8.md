## 8.67.Â Texinfo-6.8

The Texinfo package contains programs for reading, writing, and converting info pages.

**Approximate build time:**0.6 SBU

**Required disk space:**112 MB

### 8.67.1. Installation of Texinfo

Prepare Texinfo for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr

Again, fix an issue building the package with Glibc-2.34 or later:

sed -e 's/__attribute_nonnull__/__nonnull/' \
    -i gnulib/lib/malloc/dynarray-skeleton.c

Compile the package:

make

To test the results, issue:

make check

Install the package:

make install

Optionally, install the components belonging in a TeX installation:

make TEXMF=/usr/share/texmf install-tex

**The meaning of the make parameter:**

_`TEXMF=/usr/share/texmf`_

The `TEXMF` makefile variable holds the location of the root of the TeX tree if, for example, a TeX package will be installed later.

The Info documentation system uses a plain text file to hold its list of menu entries. The file is located at `/usr/share/info/dir`. Unfortunately, due to occasional problems in the Makefiles of various packages, it can sometimes get out of sync with the info pages installed on the system. If the `/usr/share/info/dir` file ever needs to be recreated, the following optional commands will accomplish the task:

pushd /usr/share/info
  rm -v dir
  for f in *
    do install-info $f dir 2>/dev/null
  done
popd
