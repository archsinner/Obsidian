## 8.69.Â Eudev-3.2.11

The Eudev package contains programs for dynamic creation of device nodes.

**Approximate build time:**0.2 SBU

**Required disk space:**83 MB

### 8.69.1. Installation of Eudev

Prepare Eudev for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr           \
            --bindir=/usr/sbin      \
            --sysconfdir=/etc       \
            --enable-manpages       \
            --disable-static

Compile the package:

make

Create some directories now that are needed for tests, but will also be used as a part of installation:

mkdir -pv /usr/lib/udev/rules.d
mkdir -pv /etc/udev/rules.d

To test the results, issue:

make check

Install the package:

make install

Install some custom rules and support files useful in an LFS environment:

tar -xvf ../udev-lfs-20171102.tar.xz
make -f udev-lfs-20171102/Makefile.lfs install

### 8.69.2. Configuring Eudev

Information about hardware devices is maintained in the `/etc/udev/hwdb.d` and `/usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d` directories. Eudev needs that information to be compiled into a binary database `/etc/udev/hwdb.bin`. Create the initial database:

udevadm hwdb --update

This command needs to be run each time the hardware information is updated.

### 8.69.3. Contents of Eudev

**Installed programs:**udevadm and udevd

**Installed libraries:**libudev.so

**Installed directories:**/etc/udev, /usr/lib/udev, and /usr/share/doc/udev-udev-lfs-20171102

#### Short Descriptions

**udevadm**

Generic udev administration tool: controls the udevd daemon, provides info from the Udev database, monitors uevents, waits for uevents to finish, tests Udev configuration, and triggers uevents for a given device

**udevd**

A daemon that listens for uevents on the netlink socket, creates devices and runs the configured external programs in response to these uevents

`libudev`

A library interface to udev device information

`/etc/udev`

Contains Udev configuration files, device permissions, and rules for device naming
