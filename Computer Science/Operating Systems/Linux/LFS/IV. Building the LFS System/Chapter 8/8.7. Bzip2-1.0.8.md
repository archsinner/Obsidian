## 8.7. Bzip2-1.0.8

The Bzip2 package contains programs for compressing and decompressing files. Compressing text files with **bzip2** yields a much better compression percentage than with the traditional **gzip**.

**Approximate build time:**less than 0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**7.2 MB

### 8.7.1. Installation of Bzip2

Apply a patch that will install the documentation for this package:

patch -Np1 -i ../bzip2-1.0.8-install_docs-1.patch

The following command ensures installation of symbolic links are relative:

sed -i 's@\(ln -s -f \)$(PREFIX)/bin/@\1@' Makefile

Ensure the man pages are installed into the correct location:

sed -i "s@(PREFIX)/man@(PREFIX)/share/man@g" Makefile

Prepare Bzip2 for compilation with:

make -f Makefile-libbz2_so
make clean

**The meaning of the make parameter:**

_`-f Makefile-libbz2_so`_

This will cause Bzip2 to be built using a different `Makefile` file, in this case the `Makefile-libbz2_so` file, which creates a dynamic `libbz2.so` library and links the Bzip2 utilities against it.

Compile and test the package:

make

Install the programs:

make PREFIX=/usr install

Install the shared library:

cp -av libbz2.so.* /usr/lib
ln -sv libbz2.so.1.0.8 /usr/lib/libbz2.so

Install the shared **bzip2** binary into the `/usr/bin` directory, and replace two copies of **bzip2** with symlinks:

cp -v bzip2-shared /usr/bin/bzip2
for i in /usr/bin/{bzcat,bunzip2}; do
  ln -sfv bzip2 $i
done

Remove a useless static library:

rm -fv /usr/lib/libbz2.a

### 8.7.2. Contents of Bzip2

#### Short Descriptions

**bunzip2**

Decompresses bzipped files

**bzcat**

Decompresses to standard output

**bzcmp**

Runs **cmp** on bzipped files

**bzdiff**

Runs **diff** on bzipped files

**bzegrep**

Runs **egrep** on bzipped files

**bzfgrep**

Runs **fgrep** on bzipped files

**bzgrep**

Runs **grep** on bzipped files

**bzip2**

Compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm with Huffman coding; the compression rate is better than that achieved by more conventional compressors using “Lempel-Ziv” algorithms, like **gzip**

**bzip2recover**

Tries to recover data from damaged bzipped files

**bzless**

Runs **less** on bzipped files

**bzmore**

Runs **more** on bzipped files

`libbz2`

The library implementing lossless, block-sorting data compression, using the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm
