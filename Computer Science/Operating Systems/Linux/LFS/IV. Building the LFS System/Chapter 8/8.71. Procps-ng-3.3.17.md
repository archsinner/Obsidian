The Procps-ng package contains programs for monitoring processes.

### Note

This package extracts to the directory `procps-3.3.17`, not the expected `procps-ng-3.3.17`.

**Approximate build time:**0.4 SBU

**Required disk space:**19 MB

### 8.71.1. Installation of Procps-ng

Prepare procps-ng for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr                            \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/procps-ng-3.3.17 \
            --disable-static                         \
            --disable-kill

**The meaning of the configure option:**

_`--disable-kill`_

This switch disables building the **kill** command that will be installed by the Util-linux package.

Compile the package:

make

To run the test suite, run:

make check

Five tests related to pkill are known to fail due to a problem with tests that were not updated.

Install the package:

make install

#### Short Descriptions

**free**

Reports the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap memory) in the system

**pgrep**

Looks up processes based on their name and other attributes

**pidof**

Reports the PIDs of the given programs

**pkill**
