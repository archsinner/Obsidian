### 8.72.1. Installation of Util-linux

Prepare Util-linux for compilation:

./configure ADJTIME_PATH=/var/lib/hwclock/adjtime   \
            --bindir=/usr/bin    \
            --libdir=/usr/lib    \
            --sbindir=/usr/sbin  \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/util-linux-2.37.4 \
            --disable-chfn-chsh  \
            --disable-login      \
            --disable-nologin    \
            --disable-su         \
            --disable-setpriv    \
            --disable-runuser    \
            --disable-pylibmount \
            --disable-static     \
            --without-python     \
            --without-systemd    \
            --without-systemdsystemunitdir

The --disable and --without options prevent warnings about building components that require packages not in LFS or are inconsistent with programs installed by other packages.

Compile the package:

make

If desired, run the test suite as a non-root user:

### Warning

Running the test suite as the `root` user can be harmful to your system. To run it, the CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG option for the kernel must be available in the currently running system and must be built as a module. Building it into the kernel will prevent booting. For complete coverage, other BLFS packages must be installed. If desired, this test can be run after rebooting into the completed LFS system and running:

bash tests/run.sh --srcdir=$PWD --builddir=$PWD

### Note

There is one test that fails in the chroot envronment and causes the tests to hang forever. The problem does not occur outside of the chroot envronment. To work around the problem, delete the test:

rm tests/ts/lsns/ioctl_ns

chown -Rv tester .
su tester -c "make -k check"

Install the package:

make install
