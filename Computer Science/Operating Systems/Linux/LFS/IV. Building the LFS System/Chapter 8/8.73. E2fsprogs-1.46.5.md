## 8.73.Â E2fsprogs-1.46.5

The e2fsprogs package contains the utilities for handling the `ext2` file system. It also supports the `ext3` and `ext4` journaling file systems.

**Approximate build time:**4.4 SBU on a spinning disk, 1.3 SBU on an SSD

**Required disk space:**93 MB

### 8.73.1. Installation of E2fsprogs

The e2fsprogs documentation recommends that the package be built in a subdirectory of the source tree:

mkdir -v build
cd       build

Prepare e2fsprogs for compilation:

../configure --prefix=/usr           \
             --sysconfdir=/etc       \
             --enable-elf-shlibs     \
             --disable-libblkid      \
             --disable-libuuid       \
             --disable-uuidd         \
             --disable-fsck

**The meaning of the configure options:**

_`--enable-elf-shlibs`_

This creates the shared libraries which some programs in this package use.

_`--disable-*`_

This prevents e2fsprogs from building and installing the `libuuid` and `libblkid` libraries, the `uuidd` daemon, and the **fsck** wrapper, as util-linux installs more recent versions.

Compile the package:

make

To run the tests, issue:

make check

One test, u_direct_io, is known to fail on some systems.

Install the package:

make install

Remove useless static libraries:

rm -fv /usr/lib/{libcom_err,libe2p,libext2fs,libss}.a

This package installs a gzipped `.info` file but doesn't update the system-wide `dir` file. Unzip this file and then update the system `dir` file using the following commands:

gunzip -v /usr/share/info/libext2fs.info.gz
install-info --dir-file=/usr/share/info/dir /usr/share/info/libext2fs.info

If desired, create and install some additional documentation by issuing the following commands:

makeinfo -o      doc/com_err.info ../lib/et/com_err.texinfo
install -v -m644 doc/com_err.info /usr/share/info
install-info --dir-file=/usr/share/info/dir /usr/share/info/com_err.info

#### Short Descriptions

**badblocks**

Searches a device (usually a disk partition) for bad blocks

**chattr**

Changes the attributes of files on an `ext2` file system; it also changes `ext3` file systems, the journaling version of `ext2` file systems

**compile_et**

An error table compiler; it converts a table of error-code names and messages into a C source file suitable for use with the `com_err` library

**debugfs**

A file system debugger; it can be used to examine and change the state of an `ext2` file system

**dumpe2fs**

Prints the super block and blocks group information for the file system present on a given device

**e2freefrag**

Reports free space fragmentation information

**e2fsck**

Is used to check, and optionally repair `ext2` file systems and `ext3` file systems

**e2image**

Is used to save critical `ext2` file system data to a file

**e2label**

Displays or changes the file system label on the `ext2` file system present on a given device

**e2mmpstatus**

Checks MMP status of an ext4 filesystem

**e2scrub**

Checks the contents of a mounted ext[234] filesystem

**e2scrub_all**

Checks all mounted ext[234] filesystems for errors

**e2undo**

Replays the undo log undo_log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem found on a device [This can be used to undo a failed operation by an e2fsprogs program.]

**e4crypt**

Ext4 filesystem encryption utility

**e4defrag**

Online defragmenter for ext4 filesystems

**filefrag**

Reports on how badly fragmented a particular file might be

**fsck.ext2**

By default checks `ext2` file systems and is a hard link to **e2fsck**

**fsck.ext3**

By default checks `ext3` file systems and is a hard link to **e2fsck**

**fsck.ext4**

By default checks `ext4` file systems and is a hard link to **e2fsck**

**logsave**

Saves the output of a command in a log file

**lsattr**

Lists the attributes of files on a second extended file system

**mk_cmds**

Converts a table of command names and help messages into a C source file suitable for use with the `libss` subsystem library

**mke2fs**

**mklost+found**

Used to create a `lost+found` directory on an `ext2` file system; it pre-allocates disk blocks to this directory to lighten the task of **e2fsck**

**resize2fs**
