**Approximate build time:**less than 0.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**0.6 MB

### 8.74.1. Installation of Sysklogd

First, fix problems that causes a segmentation fault under some conditions in klogd and fix an obsolete program construct:

make

This package does not come with a test suite.

Install the package:

make BINDIR=/sbin install

`# Begin /etc/syslog.conf

auth,authpriv.* -/var/log/auth.log
*.*;auth,authpriv.none -/var/log/sys.log
daemon.* -/var/log/daemon.log

### 8.74.3. Contents of Sysklogd

**Installed programs:**klogd and syslogd

#### Short Descriptions

**klogd**

A system daemon for intercepting and logging kernel messages

**syslogd**

Logs the messages that system programs offer for logging [Every logged message contains at least a date stamp and a hostname, and normally the program's name too, but that depends on how trusting the logging daemon is told to be.]
