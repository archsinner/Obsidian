#### Short Descriptions

**bootlogd**

Logs boot messages to a log file

**fstab-decode**

Run a command with fstab-encoded arguments

**halt**

Normally invokes **shutdown** with the _`-h`_ option, except when already in run-level 0, then it tells the kernel to halt the system; it notes in the file `/var/log/wtmp` that the system is being brought down

**init**

The first process to be started when the kernel has initialized the hardware which takes over the boot process and starts all the proceses specified in its configuration file

**killall5**

Sends a signal to all processes, except the processes in its own session so it will not kill its parent shell

**poweroff**

Tells the kernel to halt the system and switch off the computer (see **halt**)

**reboot**

Tells the kernel to reboot the system (see **halt**)

**runlevel**

Reports the previous and the current run-level, as noted in the last run-level record in `/run/utmp`
