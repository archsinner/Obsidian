## 8.78. Cleaning Up

Finally, clean up some extra files left around from running tests:

rm -rf /tmp/*

There are also several files installed in the /usr/lib and /usr/libexec directories with a file name extension of .la. These are "libtool archive" files. As already said, they are only useful when linking with static libraries. They are unneeded, and potentially harmful, when using dynamic shared libraries, specially when using also non-autotools build systems. To remove them, run:

find /usr/lib /usr/libexec -name \*.la -delete

For more information about libtool archive files, see the [BLFS section "About Libtool Archive (.la) files"](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.1/introduction/la-files.html).

The compiler built in [Chapter 6](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#chapter-temporary-tools "Chapter 6. Cross Compiling Temporary Tools") and [Chapter 7](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-11.1-NOCHUNKS.html#chapter-chroot-temporary-tools "Chapter 7. Entering Chroot and Building Additional Temporary Tools") is still partially installed and not needed anymore. Remove it with:

find /usr -depth -name $(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu\* | xargs rm -rf

Finally, remove the temporary 'tester' user account created at the beginning of the previous chapter.

userdel -r tester
