## 8.9.Â Zstd-1.5.2

Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-offs, while being backed by a very fast decoder.

**Approximate build time:**1.1 SBU

**Required disk space:**55 MB

### 8.9.1. Installation of Zstd

Compile the package:

make

### Note

In the test output there are several places that indicate 'failed'. These are expected and only 'FAIL' is an actual test failure. There should be no test failures.

To test the results, issue:

make check

Install the package:

make prefix=/usr install

Remove the static library:

rm -v /usr/lib/libzstd.a
