#### Short Descriptions

**checkfs**

Checks the integrity of the file systems before they are mounted (with the exception of journal and network based file systems)

**cleanfs**

Removes files that should not be preserved between reboots, such as those in `/run/` and `/var/lock/`; it re-creates `/run/utmp` and removes the possibly present `/etc/nologin`, `/fastboot`, and `/forcefsck` files

**console**

Loads the correct keymap table for the desired keyboard layout; it also sets the screen font

**functions**

Contains common functions, such as error and status checking, that are used by several bootscripts

**halt**

Halts the system

**ifdown**

Stops a network device

**ifup**

Initializes a network device

**localnet**

Sets up the system's hostname and local loopback device

**modules**

Loads kernel modules listed in `/etc/sysconfig/modules`, using arguments that are also given there

**mountfs**

Mounts all file systems, except ones that are marked _noauto_ or are network based

**mountvirtfs**

Mounts virtual kernel file systems, such as `proc`

**network**

Sets up network interfaces, such as network cards, and sets up the default gateway (where applicable)

**rc**

The master run-level control script; it is responsible for running all the other bootscripts one-by-one, in a sequence determined by the name of the symbolic links being processed

**reboot**

Reboots the system

**sendsignals**

Makes sure every process is terminated before the system reboots or halts

**setclock**

Resets the kernel clock to local time in case the hardware clock is not set to UTC time

**ipv4-static**

Provides the functionality needed to assign a static Internet Protocol (IP) address to a network interface

**swap**

Enables and disables swap files and partitions

**sysctl**

Loads system configuration values from `/etc/sysctl.conf`, if that file exists, into the running kernel

**sysklogd**

Starts and stops the system and kernel log daemons

**template**

A template to create custom bootscripts for other daemons

**udev**

Prepares the `/dev` directory and starts Udev

**udev_retry**

Retries failed udev uevents, and copies generated rules files from `/run/udev` to `/etc/udev/rules.d` if required
