## Tuples
[[Basic types]]

Elixir uses curly brackets to define tuples. Like lists, tuples can hold any value:

```
iex> {:ok, "hello"}
{:ok, "hello"}
iex> tuple_size {:ok, "hello"}
2
```

Tuples store elements contiguously in memory. This means accessing a tuple element by index or getting the tuple size is a fast operation. Indexes start from zero:

```
iex> tuple = {:ok, "hello"}
{:ok, "hello"}
iex> elem(tuple, 1)
"hello"
iex> tuple_size(tuple)
2
```

It is also possible to put an element at a particular index in a tuple with `put_elem/3`:

```
iex> tuple = {:ok, "hello"}
{:ok, "hello"}
iex> put_elem(tuple, 1, "world")
{:ok, "world"}
iex> tuple
{:ok, "hello"}
```

Notice that `put_elem/3` returned a new tuple. The original tuple stored in the `tuple` variable was not modified. Like lists, tuples are also immutable. Every operation on a tuple returns a new tuple, it never changes the given one.
