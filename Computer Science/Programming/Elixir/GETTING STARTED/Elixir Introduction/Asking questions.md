## Asking questions
[[Elixir Introduction]]
When going through this getting started guide, it is common to have questions; after all, that is part of the learning process! There are many places where you can ask questions, here are some of them:

-   [#elixir on irc.libera.chat](irc://irc.libera.chat/elixir)
-   [Elixir Forum](http://elixirforum.com/)
-   [Elixir on Slack](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/)
-   [Elixir on Discord](https://discord.gg/elixir)
-   [elixir tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/elixir)

When asking questions, remember these two tips:

-   Instead of asking “how to do X in Elixir”, ask “how to solve Y in Elixir”. In other words, don’t ask how to implement a particular solution, instead describe the problem at hand. Stating the problem gives more context and less bias for a correct answer.
    
-   In case things are not working as expected, please include as much information as you can in your report, for example: your Elixir version, the code snippet and the error message alongside the error stacktrace. Use sites like [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to paste this information.
