[[Elixir Introduction]]
After getting familiar with the basics of the language you may want to try writing simple programs. This can be accomplished by putting the following Elixir code into a file:

```
IO.puts("Hello world from Elixir")
```

Save it as `simple.exs` and execute it with `elixir`:

```
$ elixir simple.exs
Hello world from Elixir
```

Later on we will learn how to compile Elixir code (in [Chapter 8](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/modules-and-functions.html)) and how to use the Mix build tool (in the [Mix & OTP guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)). For now, letâ€™s move on to [Chapter 2](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html).
