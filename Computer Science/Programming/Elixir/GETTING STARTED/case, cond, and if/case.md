## case
[[case, cond, and if]]

`case` allows us to compare a value against many patterns until we find a matching one:

```
iex> case {1, 2, 3} do
...>   {4, 5, 6} ->
...>     "This clause won't match"
...>   {1, x, 3} ->
...>     "This clause will match and bind x to 2 in this clause"
...>   _ ->
...>     "This clause would match any value"
...> end
"This clause will match and bind x to 2 in this clause"
```

If you want to pattern match against an existing variable, you need to use the `^` operator:

```
iex> x = 1
1
iex> case 10 do
...>   ^x -> "Won't match"
...>   _ -> "Will match"
...> end
"Will match"
```

Clauses also allow extra conditions to be specified via guards:

```
iex> case {1, 2, 3} do
...>   {1, x, 3} when x > 0 ->
...>     "Will match"
...>   _ ->
...>     "Would match, if guard condition were not satisfied"
...> end
"Will match"
```

The first clause above will only match when `x` is positive.

Keep in mind errors in guards do not leak but simply make the guard fail:

```
iex> hd(1)
** (ArgumentError) argument error
iex> case 1 do
...>   x when hd(x) -> "Won't match"
...>   x -> "Got #{x}"
...> end
"Got 1"
```

If none of the clauses match, an error is raised:

```
iex> case :ok do
...>   :error -> "Won't match"
...> end
** (CaseClauseError) no case clause matching: :ok
```

Consult [the full documentation for guards](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/patterns-and-guards.html#guards) for more information about guards, how they are used, and what expressions are allowed in them.

Note anonymous functions can also have multiple clauses and guards:

```
iex> f = fn
...>   x, y when x > 0 -> x + y
...>   x, y -> x * y
...> end
#Function<12.71889879/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex> f.(1, 3)
4
iex> f.(-1, 3)
-3
```

The number of arguments in each anonymous function clause needs to be the same, otherwise an error is raised.

```
iex> f2 = fn
...>   x, y when x > 0 -> x + y
...>   x, y, z -> x * y + z
...> end
** (CompileError) iex:1: cannot mix clauses with different arities in anonymous functions
```
