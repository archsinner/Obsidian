JavaScript is a scripting language that is mostly used in web development. JavaScript runs in the front-end, so it can update HTML elements, connect to a server (e.g Database server, File Server etc.), change page style (CSS) and more.

## JavaScript in HTML file

HTML has the `<script>` tag, which allows scripts in a web page.

Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello, JavaScript!</p>
</body>
<script>
console.log("Hello World!");
</script>
</html>
```

"Hello World!" will show in your browser's console.

## External JavaScript

You can import a JavaScript (.js) file. This is useful for organizing your website.

JS File (example.js):

```
console.log("Hello World!");
```

HTML File:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>External JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>External JavaScript!</p>
</body>
<script src="example.js"></script>
</html>
```

The `src` attribute, imports the specified JavaScript file.

Also the `src` attribute, can import scripts from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). That is mostly used for including JavaScript libraries.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>External CDN JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>External CDN JavaScript!</p>
</body>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</html>
```

## The `type` attribute

The `<script>` tag has the `type` attribute, which specifies the scripting language that is going to be used in the `<script>` tag. Now it's almost obsolete. JavaScript is the default.

They would use this in the HTML4 days:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Other scripting languages</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Other scripting languages</p>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
console.log("Hello World");
</script>
</html>
```
