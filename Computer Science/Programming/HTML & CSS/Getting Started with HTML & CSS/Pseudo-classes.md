# Pseudo-classes
[[HTML & CSS]]
---

HTML provides pseudo-classes, classes that are defined by default and allow us to apply a style on either:

1.  An element which is in a specific state.
2.  A specific set of elements by their hierarchy, explained in detail in the [Advanced Selectors](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Advanced_Selectors) section.

We will discuss the former in this page, and give examples for each pseudo-class. Keep in mind that there is no way of inlining pseudo-classes in CSS.

### Links

A link can either be in an unvisited state or a visited state. An unvisited link is a link that was not clicked on. A visited link is a link that was clicked on.

```html
<style>
a.special:link {
    color: green;
}

a.special:visited {
    color: red;
}
</style>

<p><a href="#">This is a standard link, it will become purple when clicked</a></p>
<p><a class="special" href="#">This is a special colored link and become red when clicked</a></p>
```

### Hover

The CSS :hover pseudo-class can be used to define styles for HTML elements which the user is hovering upon using the mouse.

```html
<style>
p:hover {
    background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
<p>Paragraphs now have a yellow background when hovering over them.</p>
```

### Active and Target

The CSS :active pseudo-class defines the styles to use for an element which is currently being clicked.

```html
<style>
a:active {
    font-weight: bold;    
}
</style>
<p>
    <a href="#first">First Section</a>
    <a href="#second">Second Section</a>
    <a href="#third">Third Section</a>
</p>
```

Navigating to a specific section in the page also allows us to style the destination element.

```html
<style>
p:target {
    font-weight: bold;    
}
</style>
<p>
    <a href="#first">First Section</a>
    <a href="#second">Second Section</a>
    <a href="#third">Third Section</a>
</p>
<p id="first">This is the text of the first section.</p>
<p id="second">This is the text of the second section.</p>
<p id="third">This is the text of the third section.</p>
```

### Focus

The CSS :focus pseudo-class defines the styles to use for an element which is focused.

```html
<style>
input:focus {
    font-weight: bold;    
}
</style>
<form>
    <p><input type="text" value="First field"></p>
    <p><input type="text" value="Second field"></p>
    <p><input type="text" value="Third field"></p>        
</form>
```
