# For loops

---

For loops are simple loops which helps us iterate over an iterable variable by using an index. There are two types of for loops - a simple (C style) for loop, and a foreach loop.

### For loop

For loops are very useful when we need to iterate over an array and refer to member of the array using a changing index. For example, let's say we have a list of odd numbers. To print them out, we need to refer to each item individually. The code we write in the for loop can use the index `i`, which changes in every iteration of the for loop.

```php
$odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7,9];
for ($i = 0; $i < count($odd_numbers); $i=$i+1) {
    $odd_number = $odd_numbers[$i];
    echo $odd_number . "\n";
}
```

The first line of the for loop defines 3 parts:

-   The initialization statement - in our case, we initialize the iterator variable `$i` to 0.
-   The condition statement - this statement gets evaluated in every loop. The loop stops when this condition is unmet. This will happen when the iterator variable `$i` will be larger than the length of the array.
-   The increment statement - this statement is executed every iteration to increase the index variable by the needed amount. Usually, we will increase `$i` by 1. There are two shorter ways of increasing a variable by 1 as well. We can use `$i+=1` or `$i++` as well.

### Foreach loop

The foreach loop iterates over an iterable element such as an array or an object, providing the members in a specific variable one at a time.

For example, let's say we want to create a list of all the odd numbers between 1 and 10, and print them out one by one, like in the previous example. This time, we will be using the `foreach` statement instead of a regular `for` loop wih an iterator variable. Instead of using the iterator variable as an index to the array, we get the item from the array directly into the `$odd_number` variable.

```php
$odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7,9];
foreach ($odd_numbers as $odd_number) {
  echo $odd_number . "\n";
}
```

When iterating over arrays with keys, we can use the following syntax:

```php
$phone_numbers = [
  "Alex" => "415-235-8573",
  "Jessica" => "415-492-4856",
];

foreach ($phone_numbers as $name => $number) {
  echo "$name's number is $number.\n";
}
```

## Exercise

Print out all numbers inside the array, one by one, using the `\n` newline character sequence to separate between results.
