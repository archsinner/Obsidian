## Github

All of these notes that were taken will be included as a whole vault with an index in the README for people to use freely and I will be uploading it as a repository that can be cloned locally from Github along with all my programs. Hope this helped someone and many blessings. If it's down it means I'm in the process of updating and please check back at a later time.
