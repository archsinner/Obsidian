# Arrays
[[Ruby]]
---

Arrays allow you to group multiple values together in a list. Each value in an array is referred to as an "element".

The code below demonstrates how to create arrays:

```ruby
myArray = []  # an empty array
myOtherArray = [1, 2, 3]  # an array with three elements
```

Elements are numbered starting at zero and can be accessed by their number. `myOtherArray[1]` is how you would access the second element in an array.

In order to add to or change elements in an array, you can refer to an element by number.

```ruby
myOtherArray[3] = 4
```
