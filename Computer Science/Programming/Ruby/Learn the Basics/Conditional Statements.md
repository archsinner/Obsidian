# Conditional Statements
[[Ruby]]
---

Conditionals are used to add branching logic to your programs; they allow you to include complex behaviour that only occurs under specific conditions.

Here is the syntax of an `if` statement:

```ruby
if condition
  something to be done
end
```

`condition` is an expression that can be checked for truth. If the expression evaluates to `true`, then the code within the block is executed.

Here are some examples of expressions that evaluate to `true`:

```ruby
3 < 4
true
"cat" == "cat"
```

You can combine `if` with the keyword `else`. This lets you execute one block of code if the condition is `true`, and a different block if it is `false`.

```ruby
if condition
  something to be done
else
  something to be done if the condition evaluates to false
end
```

The `else` block will only be executed if the `if` block doesn't run, so they will never both be executed.

When you want more than two options, you can use `elsif`. This allows you to add more conditions to be checked.

Here is if/elsif/else statement syntax:

```ruby
if condition
  something to be done
elsif different condition
  something else to be done
else
  another different thing to be done
end
```

Still only one of the code blocks will be run, because the statement only executes the code in the first applicable block; Once a condition has been satisfied, the whole statement ends.

Below is an actual example of an `if` statement with both an `elsif` and an `else`.

```ruby
booleanOne = true
randomCode = "Hi!"
if booleanOne
  puts "I will be printed!"
elsif randomCode.length>=1
  puts "Even though the above code is true, I won't be executed because the earlier if statement was true!"
else
  puts "I won't be printed because the if statement was executed!"
end
```
