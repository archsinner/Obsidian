# Math in Ruby
[[Ruby]]
---

You can use Ruby to perform mathematical calculations. The four standard operators are probably familiar to you:

-   `+` for addition
-   `-` for subtraction
-   `*` for multiplication
-   `/` for division

Two other less-familiar but important operators are `**` and `%`.

`**` is used for exponents; `5**2` is 5 to the power of 2, which is 25.

`%` is a little weird. In Ruby, it isn't percent, it is modulo. Modulo is like division, but it gives you just the remainder of a division problem.

```ruby
moduloAnswer=5%2 #moduloAnswer=1
exponentAnswer=2**3 #exponentAnswer=8
```
