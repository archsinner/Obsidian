# Methods
[[Ruby]]
---

Methods are reuseable sections of code that perform specific tasks in our program. Using methods means that we can write simpler, more easily readable code.

In Ruby, methods look like this:

```ruby
def methodname
    # method code here
end
```

The `def` keyword begins the header of the method. This will include the name of the method along with any parameters the method will take (If we want them to have any). The body of the method will contain the code that we want the method to carry out. The method ends with the `end` keyword.

Now that we have a defined method, in order for it to perform its task we must call it. To call a defined method, we simply type the method's name in our program. For example, typing `methodname` will call our method.
