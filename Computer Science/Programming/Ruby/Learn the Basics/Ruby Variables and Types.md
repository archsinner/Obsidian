# Ruby Variables and Types
[[Ruby]]
---

A variable is a named piece of data. You can use a variable to store a value within your program, and refer to it later by the variable name.

Variables are defined using `=`:

```ruby
myFirstVariable = "I made a variable!"
```

Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then refer back to it:

```ruby
puts myFirstVariable
```

There are three main types of variable:

-   Strings (a collection of symbols inside speech marks)
-   Booleans (true or false)
-   Numbers (numeric values)
	    aString = "I'm a string!" aBoolean = true aNumber = 42
