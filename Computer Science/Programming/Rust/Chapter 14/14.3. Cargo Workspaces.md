## Cargo Workspaces


In Chapter 12, we built a package that included a binary crate and a library crate. As your project develops, you might find that the library crate continues to get bigger and you want to split up your package further into multiple library crates. In this situation, Cargo offers a feature called _workspaces_ that can help manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.

### Creating a Workspace

A _workspace_ is a set of packages that share the same _Cargo.lock_ and output directory. Let’s make a project using a workspace—we’ll use trivial code so we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to structure a workspace; we’re going to show one common way. We’ll have a workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will provide an `add_one` function, and a second library an `add_two` function. These three crates will be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating a new directory for the workspace:

`$ mkdir add
$ cd add` 

Next, in the _add_ directory, we create the _Cargo.toml_ file that will configure the entire workspace. This file won’t have a `[package]` section or the metadata we’ve seen in other _Cargo.toml_ files. Instead, it will start with a `[workspace]` section that will allow us to add members to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary crate; in this case, that path is _adder_:

Filename: Cargo.toml

`[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
]` 

Next, we’ll create the `adder` binary crate by running `cargo new` within the _add_ directory:

``$ cargo new adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` package`` 

At this point, we can build the workspace by running `cargo build`. The files in your _add_ directory should look like this:

`├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target` 

The workspace has one _target_ directory at the top level for the compiled artifacts to be placed into; the `adder` package doesn’t have its own _target_ directory. Even if we were to run `cargo build` from inside the _adder_ directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in _add/target_ rather than _add/adder/target_. Cargo structures the _target_ directory in a workspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on each other. If each crate had its own _target_ directory, each crate would have to recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to have the artifacts in its own _target_ directory. By sharing one _target_ directory, the crates can avoid unnecessary rebuilding.

### Creating the Second Package in the Workspace

Next, let’s create another member package in the workspace and call it `add-one`. Change the top-level _Cargo.toml_ to specify the _add-one_ path in the `members` list:

Filename: Cargo.toml

`[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
    "add-one",
]` 

Then generate a new library crate named `add-one`:

``$ cargo new add-one --lib
     Created library `add-one` package`` 

Your _add_ directory should now have these directories and files:

`├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add-one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target` 

In the _add-one/src/lib.rs_ file, let’s add an `add_one` function:

Filename: add-one/src/lib.rs

`pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}` 

Now that we have another package in the workspace, we can have the `adder` package with our binary depend on the `add-one` package, that has our library. First, we’ll need to add a path dependency on `add-one` to _adder/Cargo.toml_.

Filename: adder/Cargo.toml

 `add-one = { path = "../add-one" }` 

Cargo doesn’t assume that crates in a workspace will depend on each other, so we need to be explicit about the dependency relationships between the crates.

Next, let’s use the `add_one` function from the `add-one` crate in the `adder` crate. Open the _adder/src/main.rs_ file and add a `use` line at the top to bring the new `add-one` library crate into scope. Then change the `main` function to call the `add_one` function, as in Listing 14-7.

Filename: adder/src/main.rs

`use add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!(
        "Hello, world! {} plus one is {}!",
        num,
        add_one::add_one(num)
    );
}` 

Listing 14-7: Using the `add-one` library crate from the `adder` crate

Let’s build the workspace by running `cargo build` in the top-level _add_ directory!

`$ cargo build
   Compiling add-one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add-one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68s` 

To run the binary crate from the _add_ directory, we can specify which package in the workspace we want to run by using the `-p` argument and the package name with `cargo run`:

``$ cargo run -p adder
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/adder`
Hello, world! 10 plus one is 11!`` 

This runs the code in _adder/src/main.rs_, which depends on the `add-one` crate.

#### Depending on an External Package in a Workspace

Notice that the workspace has only one _Cargo.lock_ file at the top level of the workspace rather than having a _Cargo.lock_ in each crate’s directory. This ensures that all crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the `rand` package to the _adder/Cargo.toml_ and _add-one/Cargo.toml_ files, Cargo will resolve both of those to one version of `rand` and record that in the one _Cargo.lock_. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates in the workspace will always be compatible with each other. Let’s add the `rand` crate to the `[dependencies]` section in the _add-one/Cargo.toml_ file to be able to use the `rand` crate in the `add-one` crate:

Filename: add-one/Cargo.toml

`rand = "0.8.3"` 

We can now add `use rand;` to the _add-one/src/lib.rs_ file, and building the whole workspace by running `cargo build` in the _add_ directory will bring in and compile the `rand` crate. We will get one warning because we aren’t referring to the `rand` we brought into scope:

``$ cargo build
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded rand v0.8.3
   --snip--
   Compiling rand v0.8.3
   Compiling add-one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add-one)
warning: unused import: `rand`
 --> add-one/src/lib.rs:1:5
  |
1 | use rand;
  |     ^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[warn(unused_imports)]` on by default

warning: 1 warning emitted

   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 10.18s`` 

The top-level _Cargo.lock_ now contains information about the dependency of `add-one` on `rand`. However, even though `rand` is used somewhere in the workspace, we can’t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add `rand` to their _Cargo.toml_ files as well. For example, if we add `use rand;` to the _adder/src/main.rs_ file for the `adder` package, we’ll get an error:

``$ cargo build
  --snip--
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rand`
 --> adder/src/main.rs:2:5
  |
2 | use rand;
  |     ^^^^ no external crate `rand` `` 

To fix this, edit the _Cargo.toml_ file for the `adder` package and indicate that `rand` is a dependency for it as well. Building the `adder` package will add `rand` to the list of dependencies for `adder` in _Cargo.lock_, but no additional copies of `rand` will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured that every crate in every package in the workspace using the `rand` package will be using the same version. Using the same version of `rand` across the workspace saves space because we won’t have multiple copies and ensures that the crates in the workspace will be compatible with each other.

#### Adding a Test to a Workspace

For another enhancement, let’s add a test of the `add_one::add_one` function within the `add_one` crate:

Filename: add-one/src/lib.rs

`pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}` 

Now run `cargo test` in the top-level _add_ directory:

`$ cargo test
   Compiling add-one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add-one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
     Running target/debug/deps/add_one-f0253159197f7841

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

     Running target/debug/deps/adder-49979ff40686fa8e

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests add-one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s` 

The first section of the output shows that the `it_works` test in the `add-one` crate passed. The next section shows that zero tests were found in the `adder` crate, and then the last section shows zero documentation tests were found in the `add-one` crate. Running `cargo test` in a workspace structured like this one will run the tests for all the crates in the workspace.

We can also run tests for one particular crate in a workspace from the top-level directory by using the `-p` flag and specifying the name of the crate we want to test:

`$ cargo test -p add-one
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running target/debug/deps/add_one-b3235fea9a156f74

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests add-one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s` 

This output shows `cargo test` only ran the tests for the `add-one` crate and didn’t run the `adder` crate tests.

If you publish the crates in the workspace to [crates.io](https://crates.io/), each crate in the workspace will need to be published separately. The `cargo publish` command does not have an `--all` flag or a `-p` flag, so you must change to each crate’s directory and run `cargo publish` on each crate in the workspace to publish the crates.

For additional practice, add an `add-two` crate to this workspace in a similar way as the `add-one` crate!

As your project grows, consider using a workspace: it’s easier to understand smaller, individual components than one big blob of code. Furthermore, keeping the crates in a workspace can make coordination between them easier if they are often changed at the same time.
