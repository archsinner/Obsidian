## Installing Binaries from Crates.io with `cargo install`


The `cargo install` command allows you to install and use binary crates locally. This isn’t intended to replace system packages; it’s meant to be a convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others have shared on [crates.io](https://crates.io/). Note that you can only install packages that have binary targets. A _binary target_ is the runnable program that is created if the crate has a _src/main.rs_ file or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isn’t runnable on its own but is suitable for including within other programs. Usually, crates have information in the _README_ file about whether a crate is a library, has a binary target, or both.

All binaries installed with `cargo install` are stored in the installation root’s _bin_ folder. If you installed Rust using _rustup.rs_ and don’t have any custom configurations, this directory will be _$HOME/.cargo/bin_. Ensure that directory is in your `$PATH` to be able to run programs you’ve installed with `cargo install`.

For example, in Chapter 12 we mentioned that there’s a Rust implementation of the `grep` tool called `ripgrep` for searching files. If we want to install `ripgrep`, we can run the following:

``$ cargo install ripgrep
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded ripgrep v11.0.2
  Downloaded 1 crate (243.3 KB) in 0.88s
  Installing ripgrep v11.0.2
--snip--
   Compiling ripgrep v11.0.2
    Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3m 10s
  Installing ~/.cargo/bin/rg
   Installed package `ripgrep v11.0.2` (executable `rg`)`` 

The second-to-last line of the output shows the location and the name of the installed binary, which in the case of `ripgrep` is `rg`. As long as the installation directory is in your `$PATH`, as mentioned previously, you can then run `rg --help` and start using a faster, rustier tool for searching files!
