Arithmetic Operators

Simple arithmetics on variables can be done using the arithmetic expression: $((expression))

```bash
A=3
B=$((100 * $A + 5)) # 305
```

The basic operators are:

**a + b** addition (a plus b)

**a - b** substraction (a minus b)

**a * b** multiplication (a times b)

**a / b** division (integer) (a divided by b)

**a % b** modulo (the integer remainder of a divided by b)

**a** ****** **b** exponentiation (a to the power of b)
