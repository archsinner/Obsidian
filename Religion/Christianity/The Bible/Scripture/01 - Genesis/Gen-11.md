###### v2
As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.

###### v3
They said to one another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.

###### v4
They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."

###### v6
Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.

Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."

###### v8
So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.

Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
