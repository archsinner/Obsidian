###### v1 
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### v2 
"Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 

###### v3 
I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship, 

###### v4 
to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 

###### v5 
and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship. 

###### v6 
Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you: 

###### v7 
the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent, 

###### v8 
the table and its vessels, the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar of incense, 

###### v9 
the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base, 

###### v10 
the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office-- 

###### v11 
the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do." 

###### v12 
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### v13 
"Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you. 

###### v14 
You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 

###### v15 
Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. 

###### v16 
Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 

###### v17 
It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.'" 

###### v18 
When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, stone tablets, written with God's finger.
