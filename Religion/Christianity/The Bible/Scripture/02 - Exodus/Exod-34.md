###### v2 
Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. 

###### v3 
No one shall come up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain. Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain."

###### v6 
Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,

keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, on the third and on the fourth generation."

Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.

###### v10 
He said, "Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you. 

###### v11 
Observe that which I command you today. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 

###### v12 
Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare among you; 

###### v13 
but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles; 

###### v14 
for you shall worship no other god; for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. 

###### v15 
"Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice; 

###### v16 
and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods. 

###### v17 
"You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.

"You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt. 

###### v19 
"All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep. 

###### v20 
You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb. If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before me empty. 

###### v21 
"Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.

###### v23 
Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel. 

###### v24 
For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year. 

###### v25 
"You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread. The sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not be left to the morning.

###### v33 
When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.

But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 

###### v35 
The children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face shone; so Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
