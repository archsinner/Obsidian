###### v21 
Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the width of each board.

Each board had two tenons, joined to one another. He made all the boards of the tabernacle this way. 

###### v23 
He made the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.

For the far part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 

###### v28 
He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the far part.

They were double beneath, and in the same way they were all the way to its top to one ring. He did this to both of them in the two corners.

There were eight boards and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets--under every board two sockets. 

###### v31 
He made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 

###### v32 
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward. 

###### v33 
He made the middle bar to pass through in the middle of the boards from the one end to the other.

He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold as places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 

###### v35 
He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cherubim. He made it the work of a skillful workman.
