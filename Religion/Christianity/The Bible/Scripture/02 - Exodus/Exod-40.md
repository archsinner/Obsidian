He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

###### v20
He took and put the covenant into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.

###### v21
He brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the covenant, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

###### v22
He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside of the veil.

He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle.

###### v29
He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

He set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash.

###### v31
Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.

When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

###### v33

###### v34
Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle.

###### v35
Moses wasn't able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle.

###### v36
When the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;

###### v37
but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up.

###### v38
For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
