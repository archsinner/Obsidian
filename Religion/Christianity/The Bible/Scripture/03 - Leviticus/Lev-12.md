###### v1 
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### v2 
"Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean. 

###### v3 
In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 

###### v4 
She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. 

###### v5 
But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days. 

###### v6 
"'When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove, for a sin offering. 

###### v7 
He shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; then she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. "'This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female. 

###### v8 
If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.'"
