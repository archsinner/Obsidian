###### v1 
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### v2 
"This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest, 

###### v3 
and the priest shall go out of the camp. The priest shall examine him. Behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper, 

###### v4 
then the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop. 

###### v5 
The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 

###### v6

###### v9 
It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair. He shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his body in water. Then he shall be clean. 

###### v10 
"On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without defect, one ewe lamb a year old without defect, three tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and one log of oil.

The priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be cleansed, and those things, before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

###### v12 
"The priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer him for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh. 

###### v13 
He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering. It is most holy. 

###### v14 
The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 

###### v15 
The priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. 

###### v16

###### v17 
The priest shall put some of the rest of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering. 

###### v18 
The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh. 

###### v19 
"The priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness. Afterward he shall kill the burnt offering; 

###### v20 
then the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar. The priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean. 

###### v21 
"If he is poor, and can't afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil; 

###### v22 
and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering. 

###### v23 
"On the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh. 

###### v24 
The priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh. 

###### v25 
He shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering. The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 

###### v26

###### v30 
He shall offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, which ever he is able to afford, 

###### v31 
of the kind he is able to afford, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meal offering. The priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Yahweh." 

###### v32 
This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing. 

###### v33 
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 

###### v34 
"When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house in the land of your possession, 

###### v35 
then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, 'There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.' 

###### v36 
The priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is in the house not be made unclean. Afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house. 

###### v37 
He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall, 

###### v38 
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 

###### v39 
The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house, 

###### v40 
then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city. 

###### v41 
He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the city into an unclean place. 

###### v42 
They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house. 

###### v43 
"If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered, 

###### v44 
then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean. 

###### v45 
He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house's mortar. He shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place. 

###### v46 
"Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening. 

###### v47 
He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes. 

###### v48 
"If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn't spread in the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 

###### v49 
To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop. 

###### v50 
He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 

###### v51 
He shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 

###### v52 
He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet; 

###### v53 
but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean." 

###### v54 
This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch, 

###### v55 
and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house, 

###### v56 
and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot; 

###### v57 
to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.
