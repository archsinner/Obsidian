###### v3 
I also will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given of his offspring to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 

###### v4 
If the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person when he gives of his offspring to Molech, and don't put him to death, 

###### v5 
then I will set my face against that man and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him to play the prostitute with Molech, from among their people.

###### v17 
"'If a man takes his sister--his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter--and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing. They shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness. He shall bear his iniquity. 

###### v18

###### v23 
You shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 

###### v24 
But I have said to you, "You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey." I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples. 

###### v25 
"'You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean. You shall not make yourselves abominable by animal, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have separated from you as unclean for you.

###### v27 
"'A man or a woman that is a medium or is a wizard shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones. Their blood shall be upon themselves.'"
