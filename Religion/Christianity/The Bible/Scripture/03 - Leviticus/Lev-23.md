It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath." 

###### v33 
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### v34 
"Speak to the children of Israel, and say, 'On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of booths for seven days to Yahweh. 

###### v35 
On the first day shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work. 

###### v36 
Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you. You shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work. 

###### v37 
"'These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day-- 

###### v38 
in addition to the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and in addition to your gifts, and in addition to all your vows, and in addition to all your free will offerings, which you give to Yahweh. 

###### v39 
"'So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.

You shall take on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days. 

###### v41 
You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations. You shall keep it in the seventh month. 

###### v42 
You shall dwell in temporary shelters for seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in temporary shelters, 

###### v43 
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in temporary shelters when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.'" 

###### v44 
So Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.
