The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, and served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh, and didn't serve him.

The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand. 

###### v13 
Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more. 

###### v14 
Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!"

The children of Israel said to Yahweh, "We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, today." 

###### v16 
They put away the foreign gods from among them and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah. 

###### v18 
The people, the princes of Gilead, said to one another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
