###### v1 
There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 

###### v2 
He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears--behold, the silver is with me. I took it." His mother said, "May Yahweh bless my son!" 

###### v3 
He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, "I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you." 

###### v4 
When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah. 

###### v5 
The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 

###### v6 
In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes. 

###### v7 
There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there. 

###### v8 
The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he traveled. 

###### v9 
Micah said to him, "Where did you come from?" He said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live." 

###### v10 
Micah said to him, "Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food." So the Levite went in. 

###### v11 
The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons. 

###### v12 
Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 

###### v13 
Then Micah said, "Now I know that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest."
