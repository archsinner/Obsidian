and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it. 

###### v13 
For because you didn't carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn't seek him according to the ordinance."

So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.

and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. 

###### v19 
So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud;
