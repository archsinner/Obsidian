###### v1 
When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of Yahweh's covenant is in a tent." 

###### v2 
Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you." 

###### v3 
That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 

###### v4 
"Go and tell David my servant, 'Yahweh says, "You shall not build me a house to dwell in; 

###### v5 
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another. 

###### v6 
In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, 'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?'"' 

###### v7 
"Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, 'Yahweh of Armies says, "I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel. 

###### v8 
I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 

###### v9 
I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first, 

###### v10 
and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house. 

###### v11 
It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 

###### v12 
He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 

###### v13 
I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you; 

###### v14 
but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever."'" 

###### v15 
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. 

###### v16 
Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far? 

###### v17 
This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yahweh God. 

###### v18 
What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant. 

###### v19 
Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 

###### v20 
Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 

###### v21 
What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed out of Egypt? 

###### v22 
For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God. 

###### v23 
Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken. 

###### v24 
Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, 'Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.' 

###### v25 
For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. 

###### v26 
Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant. 

###### v27 
Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever."
