###### v1 
Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 

###### v2 
He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 

###### v3 
The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand. 

###### v4 
David said, "Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh's house, six thousand were officers and judges, 

###### v5 
four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise." 

###### v6 
David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 

###### v7 
Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 

###### v8 
The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. 

###### v9 
The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' households of Ladan. 

###### v10 
The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 

###### v11 
Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning. 

###### v12 
The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 

###### v13 
The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever. 

###### v14 
But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. 

###### v15 
The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 

###### v16 
The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 

###### v17 
The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 

###### v18 
The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 

###### v19 
The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 

###### v20 
The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. 

###### v21 
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 

###### v22 
Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives. 

###### v23 
The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 

###### v24 
These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses, even the heads of the fathers' houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh's house, from twenty years old and upward. 

###### v25 
For David said, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. 

###### v26 
Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service." 

###### v27 
For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward. 

###### v28 
For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh's house, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God's house; 

###### v29 
for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size; 

###### v30 
and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening; 

###### v31 
and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh; 

###### v32 
and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of Yahweh's house.
