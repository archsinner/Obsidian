###### v1 
After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. 

###### v2 
Job answered: 

###### v3 
"Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, 'There is a boy conceived.' 

###### v4 
Let that day be darkness. Don't let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it. 

###### v5 
Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes the day black terrify it. 

###### v6 
As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months. 

###### v7 
Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein. 

###### v8 
Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan. 

###### v9 
Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning, 

###### v10 
because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 

###### v11 
"Why didn't I die from the womb? Why didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me? 

###### v12 
Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse? 

###### v13 
For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest, 

###### v14 
with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves; 

###### v15 
or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 

###### v16 
or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light. 

###### v17 
There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest. 

###### v18 
There the prisoners are at ease together. They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster. 

###### v19 
The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master. 

###### v20 
"Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul, 

###### v21 
Who long for death, but it doesn't come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 

###### v22 
who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 

###### v23 
Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 

###### v24 
For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water. 

###### v25 
For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid of comes to me. 

###### v26 
I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest; but trouble comes."
