###### v1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 

###### v2 
"If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? 

###### v3 
Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands. 

###### v4 
Your words have supported him who was falling, You have made the feeble knees firm. 

###### v5 
But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled. 

###### v6 
Isn't your piety your confidence? Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope? 

###### v7 
"Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? 

###### v8 
According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same. 

###### v9 
By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed. 

###### v10 
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 

###### v11 
The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. 

###### v12 
"Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it. 

###### v13 
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 

###### v14 
fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 

###### v15 
Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up. 

###### v16 
It stood still, but I couldn't discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, 

###### v17 
'Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 

###### v18 
Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error. 

###### v19 
How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth! 

###### v20 
Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it. 

###### v21 
Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.'
