###### v1 
"Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 

###### v2 
For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple. 

###### v3 
I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 

###### v4 
His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them, 

###### v5 
whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance. 

###### v6 
For affliction doesn't come out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground; 

###### v7 
but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 

###### v8 
"But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God, 

###### v9 
who does great things that can't be fathomed, marvelous things without number; 

###### v10 
who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields; 

###### v11 
so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety. 

###### v12 
He frustrates the plans of the crafty, So that their hands can't perform their enterprise. 

###### v13 
He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong. 

###### v14 
They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night. 

###### v15 
But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty. 

###### v16 
So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. 

###### v17 
"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. 

###### v18 
For he wounds and binds up. He injures and his hands make whole. 

###### v19 
He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil will touch you. 

###### v20 
In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword. 

###### v21 
You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes. 

###### v22 
You will laugh at destruction and famine, neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth. 

###### v23 
For you will be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field will be at peace with you. 

###### v24 
You will know that your tent is in peace. You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing. 

###### v25 
You will know also that your offspring will be great, Your offspring as the grass of the earth. 

###### v26 
You will come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season. 

###### v27 
Look at this. We have searched it. It is so. Hear it, and know it for your good."
