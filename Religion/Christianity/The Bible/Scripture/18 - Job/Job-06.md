###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances! 

###### v3 
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore my words have been rash. 

###### v4 
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me. 

###### v5 
Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder? 

###### v6 
Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

###### v7 
My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me. 

###### v8 
"Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for, 

###### v9 
even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 

###### v10 
Let it still be my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn't spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 

###### v11 
What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient? 

###### v12 
Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of bronze? 

###### v13 
Isn't it that I have no help in me, that wisdom is driven away from me? 

###### v14 
"To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 

###### v15 
My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away; 

###### v16 
Which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself. 

###### v17 
In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 

###### v18 
The caravans that travel beside them turn away. They go up into the waste, and perish. 

###### v19 
The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them. 

###### v20 
They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded. 

###### v21 
For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid. 

###### v22 
Did I say, 'Give to me?' or, 'Offer a present for me from your substance?' 

###### v23 
or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand?' or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?' 

###### v24 
"Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand my error. 

###### v25 
How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove? 

###### v26 
Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind? 

###### v27 
Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend. 

###### v28 
Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I will not lie to your face. 

###### v29 
Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous. 

###### v30 
Is there injustice on my tongue? Can't my taste discern mischievous things?
