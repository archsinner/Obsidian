###### v1 
"Isn't a man forced to labor on earth? Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand? 

###### v2 
As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages, 

###### v3 
so I am made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me. 

###### v4 
When I lie down, I say, 'When will I arise, and the night be gone?' I toss and turn until the dawning of the day. 

###### v5 
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh. 

###### v6 
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. 

###### v7 
Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye will no more see good. 

###### v8 
The eye of him who sees me will see me no more. Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be. 

###### v9 
As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more. 

###### v10 
He will return no more to his house, neither will his place know him any more. 

###### v11 
"Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 

###### v12 
Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me? 

###### v13 
When I say, 'My bed will comfort me. My couch will ease my complaint;' 

###### v14 
then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions: 

###### v15 
so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones. 

###### v16 
I loathe my life. I don't want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath. 

###### v17 
What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him, 

###### v18 
that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment? 

###### v19 
How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle? 

###### v20 
If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself? 

###### v21 
Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now will I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I will not be."
