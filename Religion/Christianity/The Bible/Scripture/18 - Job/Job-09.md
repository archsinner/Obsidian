###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God? 

###### v3 
If he is pleased to contend with him, he can't answer him one time in a thousand. 

###### v4 
God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against him and prospered? 

###### v5 
He removes the mountains, and they don't know it, when he overturns them in his anger. 

###### v6 
He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble. 

###### v7 
He commands the sun and it doesn't rise, and seals up the stars. 

###### v8 
He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea. 

###### v9 
He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south. 

###### v10 
He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number. 

###### v11 
Behold, he goes by me, and I don't see him. He passes on also, but I don't perceive him. 

###### v12 
Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, 'What are you doing?' 

###### v13 
"God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him. 

###### v14 
How much less will I answer him, And choose my words to argue with him? 

###### v15 
Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn't answer him. I would make supplication to my judge. 

###### v16 
If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn't believe that he listened to my voice. 

###### v17 
For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause. 

###### v18 
He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 

###### v19 
If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, 'Who,' says he, 'will summon me?' 

###### v20 
Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me. Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse. 

###### v21 
I am blameless. I don't respect myself. I despise my life. 

###### v22 
"It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked. 

###### v23 
If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent. 

###### v24 
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it? 

###### v25 
"Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They see no good. 

###### v26 
They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey. 

###### v27 
If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;' 

###### v28 
I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent. 

###### v29 
I will be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain? 

###### v30 
If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye, 

###### v31 
yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes will abhor me. 

###### v32 
For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment. 

###### v33 
There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both. 

###### v34 
Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid; 

###### v35 
then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.
