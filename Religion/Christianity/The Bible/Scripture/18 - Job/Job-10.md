###### v1 
"My soul is weary of my life. I will give free course to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

###### v2 
I will tell God, 'Do not condemn me. Show me why you contend with me. 

###### v3 
Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel of the wicked? 

###### v4 
Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as man sees? 

###### v5 
Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man's years, 

###### v6 
that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin? 

###### v7 
Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can deliver out of your hand. 

###### v8 
"'Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, yet you destroy me. 

###### v9 
Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again? 

###### v10 
Haven't you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese? 

###### v11 
You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 

###### v12 
You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit. 

###### v13 
Yet you hid these things in your heart. I know that this is with you: 

###### v14 
if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity. 

###### v15 
If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction. 

###### v16 
If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me. 

###### v17 
You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me. 

###### v18 
"'Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me. 

###### v19 
I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 

###### v20 
Aren't my days few? Stop! Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort, 

###### v21 
before I go where I will not return from, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; 

###### v22 
the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as midnight.'"
