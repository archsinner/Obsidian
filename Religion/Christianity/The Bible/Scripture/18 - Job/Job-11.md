###### v1 
Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered, 

###### v2 
"Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified? 

###### v3 
Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, will no man make you ashamed? 

###### v4 
For you say, 'My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.' 

###### v5 
But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you, 

###### v6 
that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves. 

###### v7 
"Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty? 

###### v8 
They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know? 

###### v9 
Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

###### v10 
If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him? 

###### v11 
For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn't consider it. 

###### v12 
An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey's colt. 

###### v13 
"If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him. 

###### v14 
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents. 

###### v15 
Surely then you will lift up your face without spot; Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear: 

###### v16 
for you will forget your misery. You will remember it like waters that have passed away. 

###### v17 
Life will be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning. 

###### v18 
You will be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you will search, and will take your rest in safety. 

###### v19 
Also you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid. Yes, many will court your favor. 

###### v20 
But the eyes of the wicked will fail. They will have no way to flee. Their hope will be the giving up of the spirit."
