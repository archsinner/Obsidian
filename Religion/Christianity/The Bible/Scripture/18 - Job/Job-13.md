###### v1 
"Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear has heard and understood it. 

###### v2 
What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you. 

###### v3 
"Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God. 

###### v4 
But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value. 

###### v5 
Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise. 

###### v6 
Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips. 

###### v7 
Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him? 

###### v8 
Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God? 

###### v9 
Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him? 

###### v10 
He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality. 

###### v11 
Shall not his majesty make you afraid, and his dread fall on you? 

###### v12 
Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay. 

###### v13 
"Be silent! Leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will. 

###### v14 
Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand? 

###### v15 
Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him. 

###### v16 
This also will be my salvation, that a godless man will not come before him. 

###### v17 
Listen carefully to my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears. 

###### v18 
See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous. 

###### v19 
Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit. 

###### v20 
"Only don't do two things to me, then I will not hide myself from your face: 

###### v21 
withdraw your hand far from me, and don't let your terror make me afraid. 

###### v22 
Then call, and I will answer, or let me speak, and you answer me. 

###### v23 
How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin. 

###### v24 
Why do you hide your face, and consider me your enemy? 

###### v25 
Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble? 

###### v26 
For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth: 

###### v27 
You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet, 

###### v28 
though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
