###### v1 
"Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble. 

###### v2 
He grows up like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn't continue. 

###### v3 
Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you? 

###### v4 
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one. 

###### v5 
Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass; 

###### v6 
Look away from him, that he may rest, until he accomplishes, as a hireling, his day. 

###### v7 
"For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease. 

###### v8 
Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground, 

###### v9 
yet through the scent of water it will bud, and sprout boughs like a plant. 

###### v10 
But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he? 

###### v11 
As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up, 

###### v12 
so man lies down and doesn't rise. Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep. 

###### v13 
"Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time and remember me! 

###### v14 
If a man dies, will he live again? I would wait all the days of my warfare, until my release should come. 

###### v15 
You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire for the work of your hands. 

###### v16 
But now you count my steps. Don't you watch over my sin? 

###### v17 
My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity. 

###### v18 
"But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place; 

###### v19 
The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man. 

###### v20 
You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away. 

###### v21 
His sons come to honor, and he doesn't know it. They are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them. 

###### v22 
But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns."
