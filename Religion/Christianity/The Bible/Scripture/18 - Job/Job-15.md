###### v1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 

###### v2 
"Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind? 

###### v3 
Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good? 

###### v4 
Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God. 

###### v5 
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty. 

###### v6 
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you. 

###### v7 
"Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought out before the hills? 

###### v8 
Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself? 

###### v9 
What do you know that we don't know? What do you understand which is not in us? 

###### v10 
With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much older than your father. 

###### v11 
Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you? 

###### v12 
Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash, 

###### v13 
that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth? 

###### v14 
What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 

###### v15 
Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight; 

###### v16 
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water! 

###### v17 
"I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare 

###### v18 
(which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it; 

###### v19 
to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them): 

###### v20 
the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor. 

###### v21 
A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer will come on him. 

###### v22 
He doesn't believe that he will return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword. 

###### v23 
He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 

###### v24 
Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 

###### v25 
Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty, 

###### v26 
he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers, 

###### v27 
because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs. 

###### v28 
He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps. 

###### v29 
He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, neither will their possessions be extended on the earth. 

###### v30 
He will not depart out of darkness. The flame will dry up his branches. He will go away by the breath of God's mouth. 

###### v31 
Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness will be his reward. 

###### v32 
It will be accomplished before his time. His branch will not be green. 

###### v33 
He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and will cast off his flower as the olive tree. 

###### v34 
For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery. 

###### v35 
They conceive mischief and produce iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit."
