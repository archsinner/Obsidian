###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"I have heard many such things. You are all miserable comforters! 

###### v3 
Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? 

###### v4 
I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soul's place, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you, 

###### v5 
but I would strengthen you with my mouth. The solace of my lips would relieve you. 

###### v6 
"Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased? 

###### v7 
But now, God, you have surely worn me out. You have made all my company desolate. 

###### v8 
You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my face. 

###### v9 
He has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes on me. 

###### v10 
They have gaped on me with their mouth. They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me. 

###### v11 
God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked. 

###### v12 
I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target. 

###### v13 
His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my bile on the ground. 

###### v14 
He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs at me like a giant. 

###### v15 
I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust. 

###### v16 
My face is red with weeping. Deep darkness is on my eyelids, 

###### v17 
although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. 

###### v18 
"Earth, don't cover my blood. Let my cry have no place to rest. 

###### v19 
Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high. 

###### v20 
My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour out tears to God, 

###### v21 
that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor! 

###### v22 
For when a few years have come, I will go the way of no return.
