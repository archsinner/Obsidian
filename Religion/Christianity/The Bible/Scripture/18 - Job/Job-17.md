###### v1 
"My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct, and the grave is ready for me. 

###### v2 
Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation. 

###### v3 
"Now give a pledge. Be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me? 

###### v4 
For you have hidden their heart from understanding, Therefore you will not exalt them. 

###### v5 
He who denounces his friends for plunder, Even the eyes of his children will fail. 

###### v6 
"But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face. 

###### v7 
My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow. 

###### v8 
Upright men will be astonished at this. The innocent will stir himself up against the godless. 

###### v9 
Yet the righteous will hold to his way. He who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger. 

###### v10 
But as for you all, come back. I will not find a wise man among you. 

###### v11 
My days are past. My plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart. 

###### v12 
They change the night into day, saying 'The light is near' in the presence of darkness. 

###### v13 
If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness, 

###### v14 
if I have said to corruption, 'You are my father;' to the worm, 'My mother,' and 'My sister,' 

###### v15 
where then is my hope? As for my hope, who will see it? 

###### v16 
Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?"
