###### v1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 

###### v2 
"How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak. 

###### v3 
Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight? 

###### v4 
You who tear yourself in your anger, will the earth be forsaken for you? Or will the rock be removed out of its place? 

###### v5 
"Yes, the light of the wicked will be put out. The spark of his fire won't shine. 

###### v6 
The light will be dark in his tent. His lamp above him will be put out. 

###### v7 
The steps of his strength will be shortened. His own counsel will cast him down. 

###### v8 
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh. 

###### v9 
A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him. 

###### v10 
A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him on the path. 

###### v11 
Terrors will make him afraid on every side, and will chase him at his heels. 

###### v12 
His strength will be famished. Calamity will be ready at his side. 

###### v13 
The members of his body will be devoured. The firstborn of death will devour his members. 

###### v14 
He will be rooted out of the security of his tent. He will be brought to the king of terrors. 

###### v15 
There will dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur will be scattered on his habitation. 

###### v16 
His roots will be dried up beneath. His branch will be cut off above. 

###### v17 
His memory will perish from the earth. He will have no name in the street. 

###### v18 
He will be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 

###### v19 
He will have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he lived. 

###### v20 
Those who come after will be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened. 

###### v21 
Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn't know God."
