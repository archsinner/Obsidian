###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"How long will you torment me, and crush me with words? 

###### v3 
You have reproached me ten times. You aren't ashamed that you attack me. 

###### v4 
If it is true that I have erred, my error remains with myself. 

###### v5 
If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach, 

###### v6 
know now that God has subverted me, and has surrounded me with his net. 

###### v7 
"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice. 

###### v8 
He has walled up my way so that I can't pass, and has set darkness in my paths. 

###### v9 
He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 

###### v10 
He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. He has plucked my hope up like a tree. 

###### v11 
He has also kindled his wrath against me. He counts me among his adversaries. 

###### v12 
His troops come on together, build a siege ramp against me, and encamp around my tent. 

###### v13 
"He has put my brothers far from me. My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me. 

###### v14 
My relatives have gone away. My familiar friends have forgotten me. 

###### v15 
Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am an alien in their sight. 

###### v16 
I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. I beg him with my mouth. 

###### v17 
My breath is offensive to my wife. I am loathsome to the children of my own mother. 

###### v18 
Even young children despise me. If I arise, they speak against me. 

###### v19 
All my familiar friends abhor me. They whom I loved have turned against me. 

###### v20 
My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh. I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 

###### v21 
"Have pity on me. Have pity on me, you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me. 

###### v22 
Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 

###### v23 
"Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! 

###### v24 
That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever! 

###### v25 
But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. In the end, he will stand upon the earth. 

###### v26 
After my skin is destroyed, then I will see God in my flesh, 

###### v27 
whom I, even I, will see on my side. My eyes will see, and not as a stranger. "My heart is consumed within me. 

###### v28 
If you say, 'How we will persecute him!' because the root of the matter is found in me, 

###### v29 
be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment."
