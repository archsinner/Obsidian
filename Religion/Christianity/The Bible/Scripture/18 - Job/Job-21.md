###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation. 

###### v3 
Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on. 

###### v4 
As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn't I be impatient? 

###### v5 
Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth. 

###### v6 
When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh. 

###### v7 
"Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power? 

###### v8 
Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes. 

###### v9 
Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 

###### v10 
Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don't miscarry. 

###### v11 
They send out their little ones like a flock. Their children dance. 

###### v12 
They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 

###### v13 
They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol. 

###### v14 
They tell God, 'Depart from us, for we don't want to know about your ways. 

###### v15 
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?' 

###### v16 
Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

###### v17 
"How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger? 

###### v18 
How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away? 

###### v19 
You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for his children.' Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it. 

###### v20 
Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

###### v21 
For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 

###### v22 
"Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high? 

###### v23 
One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 

###### v24 
His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened. 

###### v25 
Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good. 

###### v26 
They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them. 

###### v27 
"Behold, I know your thoughts, the plans with which you would wrong me. 

###### v28 
For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?' 

###### v29 
Haven't you asked wayfaring men? Don't you know their evidences, 

###### v30 
that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led out to the day of wrath? 

###### v31 
Who will declare his way to his face? Who will repay him what he has done? 

###### v32 
Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men will keep watch over the tomb. 

###### v33 
The clods of the valley will be sweet to him. All men will draw after him, as there were innumerable before him. 

###### v34 
So how can you comfort me with nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?"
