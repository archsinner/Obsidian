###### v1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 

###### v2 
"Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself. 

###### v3 
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect? 

###### v4 
Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters with you into judgment? 

###### v5 
Isn't your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities. 

###### v6 
For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

###### v7 
You haven't given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 

###### v8 
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it. 

###### v9 
You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

###### v10 
Therefore snares are around you. Sudden fear troubles you, 

###### v11 
or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you. 

###### v12 
"Isn't God in the heights of heaven? See the height of the stars, how high they are! 

###### v13 
You say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness? 

###### v14 
Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn't see. He walks on the vault of the sky.' 

###### v15 
Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden, 

###### v16 
who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream, 

###### v17 
who said to God, 'Depart from us;' and, 'What can the Almighty do for us?' 

###### v18 
Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

###### v19 
The righteous see it, and are glad. The innocent ridicule them, 

###### v20 
saying, 'Surely those who rose up against us are cut off. The fire has consumed their remnant.' 

###### v21 
"Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace. By it, good will come to you. 

###### v22 
Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart. 

###### v23 
If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents. 

###### v24 
Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks. 

###### v25 
The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you. 

###### v26 
For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and will lift up your face to God. 

###### v27 
You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You will pay your vows. 

###### v28 
You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you. Light will shine on your ways. 

###### v29 
When they cast down, you will say, 'be lifted up.' He will save the humble person. 

###### v30 
He will even deliver him who is not innocent. Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
