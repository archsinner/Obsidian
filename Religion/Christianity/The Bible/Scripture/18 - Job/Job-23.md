###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"Even today my complaint is rebellious. His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning. 

###### v3 
Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat! 

###### v4 
I would set my cause in order before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 

###### v5 
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would tell me. 

###### v6 
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No, but he would listen to me. 

###### v7 
There the upright might reason with him, so I should be delivered forever from my judge. 

###### v8 
"If I go east, he is not there; if west, I can't find him; 

###### v9 
He works to the north, but I can't see him. He turns south, but I can't catch a glimpse of him. 

###### v10 
But he knows the way that I take. When he has tried me, I will come out like gold. 

###### v11 
My foot has held fast to his steps. I have kept his way, and not turned away. 

###### v12 
I haven't gone back from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 

###### v13 
But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? What his soul desires, even that he does. 

###### v14 
For he performs that which is appointed for me. Many such things are with him. 

###### v15 
Therefore I am terrified at his presence. When I consider, I am afraid of him. 

###### v16 
For God has made my heart faint. The Almighty has terrified me. 

###### v17 
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
