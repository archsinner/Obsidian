###### v1 
Then Job answered, 

###### v2 
"How have you helped him who is without power! How have you saved the arm that has no strength! 

###### v3 
How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 

###### v4 
To whom have you uttered words? Whose spirit came out of you? 

###### v5 
"The departed spirits tremble, those beneath the waters and all that live in them. 

###### v6 
Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 

###### v7 
He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs the earth on nothing. 

###### v8 
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them. 

###### v9 
He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it. 

###### v10 
He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness. 

###### v11 
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke. 

###### v12 
He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab. 

###### v13 
By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent. 

###### v14 
Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
