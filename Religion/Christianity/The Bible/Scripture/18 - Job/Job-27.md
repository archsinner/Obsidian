###### v1 
Job again took up his parable, and said, 

###### v2 
"As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter 

###### v3 
(for the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils); 

###### v4 
surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness, neither will my tongue utter deceit. 

###### v5 
Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 

###### v6 
I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart will not reproach me so long as I live. 

###### v7 
"Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. 

###### v8 
For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life? 

###### v9 
Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him? 

###### v10 
Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times? 

###### v11 
I will teach you about the hand of God. I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty. 

###### v12 
Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? 

###### v13 
"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty. 

###### v14 
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring will not be satisfied with bread. 

###### v15 
Those who remain of him will be buried in death. His widows will make no lamentation. 

###### v16 
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay; 

###### v17 
he may prepare it, but the just will put it on, and the innocent will divide the silver. 

###### v18 
He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes. 

###### v19 
He lies down rich, but he will not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not. 

###### v20 
Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night. 

###### v21 
The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place. 

###### v22 
For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand. 

###### v23 
Men will clap their hands at him, and will hiss him out of his place.
