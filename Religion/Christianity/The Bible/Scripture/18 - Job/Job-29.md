###### v1 
Job again took up his parable, and said, 

###### v2 
"Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me; 

###### v3 
when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I walked through darkness, 

###### v4 
as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was in my tent, 

###### v5 
when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me, 

###### v6 
when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me, 

###### v7 
when I went out to the city gate, when I prepared my seat in the street. 

###### v8 
The young men saw me and hid themselves. The aged rose up and stood. 

###### v9 
The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 

###### v10 
The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth. 

###### v11 
For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it commended me: 

###### v12 
Because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him, 

###### v13 
the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 

###### v14 
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem. 

###### v15 
I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame. 

###### v16 
I was a father to the needy. I researched the cause of him whom I didn't know. 

###### v17 
I broke the jaws of the unrighteous and plucked the prey out of his teeth. 

###### v18 
Then I said, 'I will die in my own house, I will count my days as the sand. 

###### v19 
My root is spread out to the waters. The dew lies all night on my branch. 

###### v20 
My glory is fresh in me. My bow is renewed in my hand.' 

###### v21 
"Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel. 

###### v22 
After my words they didn't speak again. My speech fell on them. 

###### v23 
They waited for me as for the rain. Their mouths drank as with the spring rain. 

###### v24 
I smiled on them when they had no confidence. They didn't reject the light of my face. 

###### v25 
I chose out their way, and sat as chief. I lived as a king in the army, as one who comforts the mourners.
