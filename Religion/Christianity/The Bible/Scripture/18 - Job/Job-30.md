###### v1 
"But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I considered unworthy to put with my sheep dogs. 

###### v2 
Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished? 

###### v3 
They are gaunt from lack and famine. They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation. 

###### v4 
They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The roots of the broom tree are their food. 

###### v5 
They are driven out from among men. They cry after them as after a thief; 

###### v6 
So that they dwell in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth and of the rocks. 

###### v7 
They bray among the bushes. They are gathered together under the nettles. 

###### v8 
They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men. They were flogged out of the land. 

###### v9 
"Now I have become their song. Yes, I am a byword to them. 

###### v10 
They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don't hesitate to spit in my face. 

###### v11 
For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me. 

###### v12 
On my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet, They cast up against me their ways of destruction. 

###### v13 
They mar my path. They promote my destruction without anyone's help. 

###### v14 
As through a wide breach they come. They roll themselves in amid the ruin. 

###### v15 
Terrors have turned on me. They chase my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud. 

###### v16 
"Now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold of me. 

###### v17 
In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest. 

###### v18 
My garment is disfigured by great force. It binds me about as the collar of my tunic. 

###### v19 
He has cast me into the mire. I have become like dust and ashes. 

###### v20 
I cry to you, and you do not answer me. I stand up, and you gaze at me. 

###### v21 
You have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of your hand you persecute me. 

###### v22 
You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. You dissolve me in the storm. 

###### v23 
For I know that you will bring me to death, to the house appointed for all living. 

###### v24 
"However doesn't one stretch out a hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help? 

###### v25 
Didn't I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn't my soul grieved for the needy? 

###### v26 
When I looked for good, then evil came. When I waited for light, darkness came. 

###### v27 
My heart is troubled, and doesn't rest. Days of affliction have come on me. 

###### v28 
I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help. 

###### v29 
I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches. 

###### v30 
My skin grows black and peels from me. My bones are burned with heat. 

###### v31 
Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
