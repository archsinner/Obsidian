###### v1 
"I made a covenant with my eyes, how then should I look lustfully at a young woman? 

###### v2 
For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high? 

###### v3 
Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? 

###### v4 
Doesn't he see my ways, and count all my steps? 

###### v5 
"If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit 

###### v6 
(let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity); 

###### v7 
if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands, 

###### v8 
then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 

###### v9 
"If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor's door, 

###### v10 
then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her. 

###### v11 
For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; 

###### v12 
for it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase. 

###### v13 
"If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me, 

###### v14 
what then will I do when God rises up? When he visits, what will I answer him? 

###### v15 
Didn't he who made me in the womb make him? Didn't one fashion us in the womb? 

###### v16 
"If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 

###### v17 
or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it 

###### v18 
(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, I have guided her from my mother's womb); 

###### v19 
if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 

###### v20 
if his heart hasn't blessed me, if he hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece; 

###### v21 
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate, 

###### v22 
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone. 

###### v23 
For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because of his majesty, I can do nothing. 

###### v24 
"If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence;' 

###### v25 
If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; 

###### v26 
if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor, 

###### v27 
and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, 

###### v28 
this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have denied the God who is above. 

###### v29 
"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him 

###### v30 
(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse); 

###### v31 
if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?' 

###### v32 
(the foreigner has not camped in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler); 

###### v33 
if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart, 

###### v34 
because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn't go out of the door-- 

###### v35 
oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me! Let the accuser write my indictment! 

###### v36 
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; and I would bind it to me as a crown. 

###### v37 
I would declare to him the number of my steps. I would go near to him like a prince. 

###### v38 
If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together; 

###### v39 
if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life, 

###### v40 
let briers grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
