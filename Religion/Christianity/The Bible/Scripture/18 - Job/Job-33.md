###### v1 
"However, Job, please hear my speech, and listen to all my words. 

###### v2 
See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth. 

###### v3 
My words will utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they will speak sincerely. 

###### v4 
The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 

###### v5 
If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand up. 

###### v6 
Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay. 

###### v7 
Behold, my terror will not make you afraid, neither will my pressure be heavy on you. 

###### v8 
"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying, 

###### v9 
'I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me. 

###### v10 
Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy. 

###### v11 
He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.' 

###### v12 
"Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man. 

###### v13 
Why do you strive against him, because he doesn't give account of any of his matters? 

###### v14 
For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention. 

###### v15 
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed; 

###### v16 
Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction, 

###### v17 
that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 

###### v18 
He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 

###### v19 
"He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones, 

###### v20 
so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food. 

###### v21 
His flesh is so consumed away that it can't be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out. 

###### v22 
Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers. 

###### v23 
"If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him; 

###### v24 
then God is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.' 

###### v25 
His flesh will be fresher than a child's. He returns to the days of his youth. 

###### v26 
He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness. 

###### v27 
He sings before men, and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn't profit me. 

###### v28 
He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life will see the light.' 

###### v29 
"Behold, God does all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man, 

###### v30 
to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 

###### v31 
Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak. 

###### v32 
If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you. 

###### v33 
If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
