###### v1 
Moreover Elihu answered, 

###### v2 
"Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. 

###### v3 
For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food. 

###### v4 
Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good. 

###### v5 
For Job has said, 'I am righteous, God has taken away my right: 

###### v6 
Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.' 

###### v7 
What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water, 

###### v8 
Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men? 

###### v9 
For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.' 

###### v10 
"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 

###### v11 
For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 

###### v12 
Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. 

###### v13 
Who put him in charge of the earth? Or who has appointed him over the whole world? 

###### v14 
If he set his heart on himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath, 

###### v15 
all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 

###### v16 
"If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words. 

###### v17 
Should even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?-- 

###### v18 
Who says to a king, 'Vile!' or to nobles, 'Wicked!'? 

###### v19 
He doesn't respect the persons of princes, nor respect the rich more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands. 

###### v20 
In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand. 

###### v21 
"For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings. 

###### v22 
There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 

###### v23 
For he doesn't need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment. 

###### v24 
He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place. 

###### v25 
Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 

###### v26 
He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 

###### v27 
because they turned away from following him, and wouldn't pay attention to any of his ways, 

###### v28 
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted. 

###### v29 
When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? He is over a nation or a man alike, 

###### v30 
that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. 

###### v31 
"For has any said to God, 'I am guilty, but I will not offend any more. 

###### v32 
Teach me that which I don't see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'? 

###### v33 
Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know. 

###### v34 
Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me: 

###### v35 
'Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.' 

###### v36 
I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men. 

###### v37 
For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God."
