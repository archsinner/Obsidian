###### v1 
Elihu also continued, and said, 

###### v2 
"Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God's behalf. 

###### v3 
I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

###### v4 
For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 

###### v5 
"Behold, God is mighty, and doesn't despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding. 

###### v6 
He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the afflicted. 

###### v7 
He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted. 

###### v8 
If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions, 

###### v9 
then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. 

###### v10 
He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity. 

###### v11 
If they listen and serve him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 

###### v12 
But if they don't listen, they will perish by the sword; they will die without knowledge. 

###### v13 
"But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don't cry for help when he binds them. 

###### v14 
They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean. 

###### v15 
He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression. 

###### v16 
Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a wide place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness. 

###### v17 
"But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you. 

###### v18 
Don't let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside. 

###### v19 
Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength? 

###### v20 
Don't desire the night, when people are cut off in their place. 

###### v21 
Take heed, don't regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction. 

###### v22 
Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him? 

###### v23 
Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, 'You have committed unrighteousness?' 

###### v24 
"Remember that you magnify his work, about which men have sung. 

###### v25 
All men have looked on it. Man sees it afar off. 

###### v26 
Behold, God is great, and we don't know him. The number of his years is unsearchable. 

###### v27 
For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor, 

###### v28 
which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly. 

###### v29 
Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds, and the thunderings of his pavilion? 

###### v30 
Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea. 

###### v31 
For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance. 

###### v32 
He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark. 

###### v33 
Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.
