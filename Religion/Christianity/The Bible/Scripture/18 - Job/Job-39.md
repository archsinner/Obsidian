###### v1 
"Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns? 

###### v2 
Can you count the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth? 

###### v3 
They bow themselves. They bear their young. They end their labor pains. 

###### v4 
Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go out, and don't return again. 

###### v5 
"Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey, 

###### v6 
whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place? 

###### v7 
He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shouting of the driver. 

###### v8 
The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after every green thing. 

###### v9 
"Will the wild ox be content to serve you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough? 

###### v10 
Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you? 

###### v11 
Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor? 

###### v12 
Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor? 

###### v13 
"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers and plumage of love? 

###### v14 
For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust, 

###### v15 
and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them. 

###### v16 
She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear, 

###### v17 
because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding. 

###### v18 
When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider. 

###### v19 
"Have you given the horse might? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane? 

###### v20 
Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome. 

###### v21 
He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men. 

###### v22 
He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn back from the sword. 

###### v23 
The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin. 

###### v24 
He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet. 

###### v25 
As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, 'Aha!' He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

###### v26 
"Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south? 

###### v27 
Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes his nest on high? 

###### v28 
On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold. 

###### v29 
From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off. 

###### v30 
His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is."
