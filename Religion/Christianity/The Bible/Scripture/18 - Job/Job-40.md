###### v1 
Moreover Yahweh answered Job, 

###### v2 
"Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it." 

###### v3 
Then Job answered Yahweh, 

###### v4 
"Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. 

###### v5 
I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further." 

###### v6 
Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind, 

###### v7 
"Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me. 

###### v8 
Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified? 

###### v9 
Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him? 

###### v10 
"Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty. 

###### v11 
Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low. 

###### v12 
Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place. 

###### v13 
Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place. 

###### v14 
Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you. 

###### v15 
"See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox. 

###### v16 
Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly. 

###### v17 
He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together. 

###### v18 
His bones are like tubes of bronze. His limbs are like bars of iron. 

###### v19 
He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword. 

###### v20 
Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play. 

###### v21 
He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh. 

###### v22 
The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him. 

###### v23 
Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn't tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth. 

###### v24 
Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
