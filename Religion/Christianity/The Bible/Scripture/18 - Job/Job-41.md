###### v1 
"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fish hook, or press down his tongue with a cord? 

###### v2 
Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through with a hook? 

###### v3 
Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you? 

###### v4 
Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever? 

###### v5 
Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your girls? 

###### v6 
Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants? 

###### v7 
Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears? 

###### v8 
Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more. 

###### v9 
Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won't one be cast down even at the sight of him? 

###### v10 
None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me? 

###### v11 
Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine. 

###### v12 
"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. 

###### v13 
Who can strip off his outer garment? Who will come within his jaws? 

###### v14 
Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror. 

###### v15 
Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal. 

###### v16 
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 

###### v17 
They are joined to one another. They stick together, so that they can't be pulled apart. 

###### v18 
His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 

###### v19 
Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap out. 

###### v20 
Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. 

###### v21 
His breath kindles coals. A flame goes out of his mouth. 

###### v22 
There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him. 

###### v23 
The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can't be moved. 

###### v24 
His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone. 

###### v25 
When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing. 

###### v26 
If one attacks him with the sword, it can't prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. 

###### v27 
He counts iron as straw; and bronze as rotten wood. 

###### v28 
The arrow can't make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him. 

###### v29 
Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin. 

###### v30 
His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. 

###### v31 
He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 

###### v32 
He makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair. 

###### v33 
On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear. 

###### v34 
He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride."
