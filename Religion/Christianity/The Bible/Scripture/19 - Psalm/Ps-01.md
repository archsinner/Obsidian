###### v1 
Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand on the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers; 

###### v2 
but his delight is in Yahweh's law. On his law he meditates day and night. 

###### v3 
He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper. 

###### v4 
The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 

###### v5 
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

###### v6 
For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.
