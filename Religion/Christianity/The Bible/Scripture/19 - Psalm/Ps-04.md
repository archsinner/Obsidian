Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.

Stand in awe, and don't sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.

Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh. 

###### v6 
Many say, "Who will show us any good?" Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us. 

###### v7 
You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. 

###### v8 
In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.
