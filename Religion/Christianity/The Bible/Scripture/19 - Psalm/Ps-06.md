###### v1 
Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath. 

###### v2 
Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 

###### v3 
My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh--how long? 

###### v4 
Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness' sake. 

###### v5 
For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks? 

###### v6 
I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears. 

###### v7 
My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries. 

###### v8 
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping. 

###### v9 
Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer. 

###### v10 
May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
