###### v1 
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language, 

###### v2 
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 

###### v3 
The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back. 

###### v4 
The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. 

###### v5 
What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan, that you turned back? 

###### v6 
You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills, like lambs? 

###### v7 
Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

###### v8 
who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
