###### v1 
Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men. 

###### v2 
Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart. 

###### v3 
May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts, 

###### v4 
who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?" 

###### v5 
"Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him." 

###### v6 
Yahweh's words are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times. 

###### v7 
You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever. 

###### v8 
The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
