###### v1 
I lift up my eyes to you, you who sit in the heavens. 

###### v2 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us. 

###### v3 
Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt. 

###### v4 
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
