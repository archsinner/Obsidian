***



###### v1 
If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, let Israel now say, 

###### v2 
if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us; 

###### v3 
then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; 

###### v4 
then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul; 

###### v5 
then the proud waters would have gone over our soul. 

###### v6 
Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. 

###### v7 
Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 

###### v8 
Our help is in Yahweh's name, who made heaven and earth.
