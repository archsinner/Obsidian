***



###### v1 
Unless Yahweh builds the house, they who build it labor in vain. Unless Yahweh watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain. 

###### v2 
It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late, eating the bread of toil, for he gives sleep to his loved ones. 

###### v3 
Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh. The fruit of the womb is his reward. 

###### v4 
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 

###### v5 
Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
