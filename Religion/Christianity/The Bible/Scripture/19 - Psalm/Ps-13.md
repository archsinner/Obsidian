###### v1 
How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 

###### v2 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me? 

###### v3 
Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 

###### v4 
lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;" lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall. 

###### v5 
But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation. 

###### v6 
I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.
