###### v1 
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 

###### v2 
On the willows in that land, we hung up our harps. 

###### v3 
For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!" 

###### v4 
How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land? 

###### v5 
If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill. 

###### v6 
Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you, if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy. 

###### v7 
Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, who said, "Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!" 

###### v8 
Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, he will be happy who repays you, as you have done to us. 

###### v9 
Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
