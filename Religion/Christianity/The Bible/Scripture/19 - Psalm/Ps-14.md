***



###### v1 
The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good. 

###### v2 
Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God. 

###### v3 
They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is no one who does good, no, not one. 

###### v4 
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on Yahweh? 

###### v5 
There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous. 

###### v6 
You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge. 

###### v7 
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
