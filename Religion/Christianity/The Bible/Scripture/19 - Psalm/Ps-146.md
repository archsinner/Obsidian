###### v1 
Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul.

While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 

###### v3 
Don't put your trust in princes, in a son of man in whom there is no help. 

###### v4 
His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish. 

###### v5 
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh, his God: 

###### v6 
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever; 

###### v7 
who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners. 

###### v8 
Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous. 

###### v9 
Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but he turns the way of the wicked upside down. 

###### v10 
Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!
