# Psalm 15

[[Ps-14|← Psalm 14]] | [[Psalm]] | [[Ps-16|Psalm 16 →]]
***



###### v1 
Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill? 

###### v2 
He who walks blamelessly and does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart; 

###### v3 
he who doesn't slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man; 

###### v4 
in whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn't change; 

###### v5 
he who doesn't lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
