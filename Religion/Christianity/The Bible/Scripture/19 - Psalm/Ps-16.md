Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.

###### v3 
As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.

Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips. 

###### v5 
Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure. 

###### v6 
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.

I have set Yahweh always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 

###### v9 
Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety. 

###### v10 
For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption. 

###### v11 
You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.
