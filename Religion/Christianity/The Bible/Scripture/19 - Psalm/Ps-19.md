###### v1 
The heavens declare the glory of God. The expanse shows his handiwork. 

###### v2 
Day after day they pour out speech, and night after night they display knowledge. 

###### v3 
There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 

###### v4 
Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, 

###### v5 
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room, like a strong man rejoicing to run his course. 

###### v6 
His going out is from the end of the heavens, his circuit to its ends. There is nothing hidden from its heat. 

###### v7 
Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul. Yahweh's covenant is sure, making wise the simple. 

###### v8 
Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes. 

###### v9 
The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether. 

###### v10 
They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb. 

###### v11 
Moreover your servant is warned by them. In keeping them there is great reward. 

###### v12 
Who can discern his errors? Forgive me from hidden errors. 

###### v13 
Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright. I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression. 

###### v14 
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
