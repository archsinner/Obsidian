###### v1 
Yahweh is my shepherd: I shall lack nothing. 

###### v2 
He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 

###### v3 
He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 

###### v4 
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 

###### v5 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. 

###### v6 
Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh's house forever.
