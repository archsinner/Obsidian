I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites. 

###### v5 
I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.

###### v8 
Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells.

Don't gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men;

in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes.

But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.

My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
