###### v1 
To you, Yahweh, I call. My rock, don't be deaf to me, lest, if you are silent to me, I would become like those who go down into the pit. 

###### v2 
Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. 

###### v3 
Don't draw me away with the wicked, with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts. 

###### v4 
Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. Give them according to the operation of their hands. Bring back on them what they deserve. 

###### v5 
Because they don't respect the works of Yahweh, nor the operation of his hands, he will break them down and not build them up. 

###### v6 
Blessed be Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my petitions. 

###### v7 
Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices. With my song I will thank him. 

###### v8 
Yahweh is their strength. He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed. 

###### v9 
Save your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.
