###### v1 
I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me. 

###### v2 
Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me. 

###### v3 
Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol. You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 

###### v4 
Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his. Give thanks to his holy name. 

###### v5 
For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning. 

###### v6 
As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved." 

###### v7 
You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled. 

###### v8 
I cried to you, Yahweh. I made supplication to the Lord: 

###### v9 
"What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare your truth? 

###### v10 
Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me. Yahweh, be my helper." 

###### v11 
You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness, 

###### v12 
to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent. Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
