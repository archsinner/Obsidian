###### v1 
A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: "There is no fear of God before his eyes." 

###### v2 
For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect and hate his sin. 

###### v3 
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good. 

###### v4 
He plots iniquity on his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not good. He doesn't abhor evil. 

###### v5 
Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. 

###### v6 
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a great deep. Yahweh, you preserve man and animal. 

###### v7 
How precious is your loving kindness, God! The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings. 

###### v8 
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures. 

###### v9 
For with you is the spring of life. In your light we will see light. 

###### v10 
Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

###### v11 
Don't let the foot of pride come against me. Don't let the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

###### v12 
There the workers of iniquity are fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
