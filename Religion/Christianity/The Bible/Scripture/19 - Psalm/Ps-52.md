###### v1 
Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? God's loving kindness endures continually. 

###### v2 
Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 

###### v3 
You love evil more than good, lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah. 

###### v4 
You love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue. 

###### v5 
God will likewise destroy you forever. He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah. 

###### v6 
The righteous also will see it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying, 

###### v7 
"Behold, this is the man who didn't make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness." 

###### v8 
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house. I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever. 

###### v9 
I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.
