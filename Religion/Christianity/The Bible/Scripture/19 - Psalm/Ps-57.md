###### v1 
Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, until disaster has passed. 

###### v2 
I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my requests for me. 

###### v3 
He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out his loving kindness and his truth. 

###### v4 
My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 

###### v5 
Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be above all the earth! 

###### v6 
They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into the middle of it themselves. Selah. 

###### v7 
My heart is steadfast, God. My heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises. 

###### v8 
Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp! I will wake up the dawn.

I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations. 

###### v10 
For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies.

Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
