# Psalm 58

###### v1 
Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men? 

###### v2 
No, in your heart you plot injustice. You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth. 

###### v3 
The wicked go astray from the womb. They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies. 

###### v4 
Their poison is like the poison of a snake, like a deaf cobra that stops its ear, 

###### v5 
which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillful the charmer may be. 

###### v6 
Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh. 

###### v7 
Let them vanish like water that flows away. When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt. 

###### v8 
Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun. 

###### v9 
Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, he will sweep away the green and the burning alike. 

###### v10 
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, 

###### v11 
so that men shall say, "Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous. Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth."
