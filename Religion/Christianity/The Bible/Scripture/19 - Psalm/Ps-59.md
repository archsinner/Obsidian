###### v1 
Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Set me on high from those who rise up against me. 

###### v2

###### v4 
I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Rise up, behold, and help me! 

###### v5 
You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish the nations. Show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah. 

###### v6 
They return at evening, howling like dogs, and prowl around the city. 

###### v7 
Behold, they spew with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, "For", they say, "who hears us?" 

###### v8 
But you, Yahweh, laugh at them. You scoff at all the nations. 

###### v9 
Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God is my high tower.

Don't kill them, or my people may forget. Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield. 

###### v12 
For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride, for the curses and lies which they utter. 

###### v13 
Consume them in wrath. Consume them, and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of the earth. Selah. 

###### v14 
At evening let them return. Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city. 

###### v15 
They shall wander up and down for food, and wait all night if they aren't satisfied.

But I will sing of your strength. Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning. For you have been my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress. 

###### v17 
To you, my strength, I will sing praises. For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
