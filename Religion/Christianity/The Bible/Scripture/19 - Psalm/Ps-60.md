###### v1 
God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again. 

###### v2 
You have made the land tremble. You have torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes. 

###### v3 
You have shown your people hard things. You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger. 

###### v4 
You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 

###### v5 
So that your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us. 

###### v6 
God has spoken from his sanctuary: "I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. 

###### v7 
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter. 

###### v8 
Moab is my wash basin. I will throw my sandal on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia." 

###### v9 
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom? 

###### v10 
Haven't you, God, rejected us? You don't go out with our armies, God. 

###### v11 
Give us help against the adversary, for the help of man is vain. 

###### v12 
Through God we will do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
