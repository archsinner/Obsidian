###### v1 
God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water. 

###### v2 
So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power and your glory. 

###### v3 
Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you. 

###### v4 
So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name. 

###### v5 
My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips, 

###### v6 
when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in the night watches. 

###### v7 
For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. 

###### v8 
My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up. 

###### v9 
But those who seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 

###### v10 
They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food. 

###### v11 
But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
