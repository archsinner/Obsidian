***



###### v1 
Hear my voice, God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

###### v2 
Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil; 

###### v3 
who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows, deadly words, 

###### v4 
to shoot innocent men from ambushes. They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly. 

###### v5 
They encourage themselves in evil plans. They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, "Who will see them?" 

###### v6 
They plot injustice, saying, "We have made a perfect plan!" Surely man's mind and heart are cunning. 

###### v7 
But God will shoot at them. They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow. 

###### v8 
Their own tongues shall ruin them. All who see them will shake their heads. 

###### v9 
All mankind shall be afraid. They shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what he has done. 

###### v10 
The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in him. All the upright in heart shall praise him!
