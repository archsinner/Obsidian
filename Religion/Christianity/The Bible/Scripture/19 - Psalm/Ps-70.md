###### v1 
Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Yahweh. 

###### v2 
Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. 

###### v3 
Let them be turned because of their shame who say, "Aha! Aha!" 

###### v4 
Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, "Let God be exalted!" 

###### v5 
But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don't delay.
