###### v1 
Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth. 

###### v2 
I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old, 

###### v3 
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 

###### v4 
We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done. 

###### v5 
For he established a covenant in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children; 

###### v6 
that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children, 

###### v7 
that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God's deeds, but keep his commandments, 

###### v8 
and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God. 

###### v9 
The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 

###### v10 
They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law. 

###### v11 
They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them. 

###### v12 
He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 

###### v13 
He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap. 

###### v14 
In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire. 

###### v15 
He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. 

###### v16 
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 

###### v17 
Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert. 

###### v18 
They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire. 

###### v19 
Yes, they spoke against God. They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 

###### v20 
Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?" 

###### v21 
Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel, 

###### v22 
because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in his salvation. 

###### v23 
Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven. 

###### v24 
He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky. 

###### v25 
Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full. 

###### v26 
He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind. 

###### v27 
He also rained meat on them as the dust, winged birds as the sand of the seas. 

###### v28 
He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations. 

###### v29 
So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire. 

###### v30 
They didn't turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths, 

###### v31 
when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their fattest, and struck down the young men of Israel. 

###### v32 
For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in his wondrous works. 

###### v33 
Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror. 

###### v34 
When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly. 

###### v35 
They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer. 

###### v36 
But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 

###### v37 
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant. 

###### v38 
But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up all his wrath. 

###### v39 
He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again. 

###### v40 
How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert! 

###### v41 
They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 

###### v42 
They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; 

###### v43 
how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan, 

###### v44 
he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink. 

###### v45 
He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 

###### v46 
He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. 

###### v47 
He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost. 

###### v48 
He also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 

###### v49 
He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil. 

###### v50 
He made a path for his anger. He didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence, 

###### v51 
and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. 

###### v52 
But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

###### v53 
He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

###### v54 
He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. 

###### v55 
He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 

###### v56 
Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies, 

###### v57 
but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow. 

###### v58 
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. 

###### v59 
When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel, 

###### v60 
so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men, 

###### v61 
and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand. 

###### v62 
He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance. 

###### v63 
Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song. 

###### v64 
Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep. 

###### v65 
Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. 

###### v66 
He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach. 

###### v67 
Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim, 

###### v68 
But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved. 

###### v69 
He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever. 

###### v70 
He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds; 

###### v71 
from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance. 

###### v72 
So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
