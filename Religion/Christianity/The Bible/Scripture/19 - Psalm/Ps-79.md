###### v1 
God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. 

###### v2 
They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth. 

###### v3 
They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them. 

###### v4 
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us. 

###### v5 
How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? 

###### v6 
Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you, on the kingdoms that don't call on your name; 

###### v7 
for they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland. 

###### v8 
Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need. 

###### v9 
Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake. 

###### v10 
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out. 

###### v11 
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death. 

###### v12 
Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord. 

###### v13 
So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations.
