###### v1 
How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Armies! 

###### v2 
My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 

###### v3 
Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God. 

###### v4 
Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. Selah. 

###### v5 
Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage. 

###### v6 
Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings. 

###### v7 
They go from strength to strength. Every one of them appears before God in Zion. 

###### v8 
Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. Listen, God of Jacob. Selah. 

###### v9 
Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed. 

###### v10 
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

###### v11 
For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly. 

###### v12 
Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
