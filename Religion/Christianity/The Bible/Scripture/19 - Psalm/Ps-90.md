###### v1 
Lord, you have been our dwelling place for all generations. 

###### v2 
Before the mountains were born, before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. 

###### v3 
You turn man to destruction, saying, "Return, you children of men." 

###### v4 
For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night. 

###### v5 
You sweep them away as they sleep. In the morning they sprout like new grass. 

###### v6 
In the morning it sprouts and springs up. By evening, it is withered and dry. 

###### v7 
For we are consumed in your anger. We are troubled in your wrath. 

###### v8 
You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. 

###### v9 
For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh. 

###### v10 
The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away. 

###### v11 
Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you? 

###### v12 
So teach us to count our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. 

###### v13 
Relent, Yahweh! How long? Have compassion on your servants! 

###### v14 
Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 

###### v15 
Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil. 

###### v16 
Let your work appear to your servants, your glory to their children. 

###### v17 
Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us. Establish the work of our hands for us. Yes, establish the work of our hands.
