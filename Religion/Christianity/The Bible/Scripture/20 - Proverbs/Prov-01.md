###### v1 
The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: 

###### v2 
to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding; 

###### v3 
to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; 

###### v4 
to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man: 

###### v5 
that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel: 

###### v6 
to understand a proverb and parables, the words and riddles of the wise. 

###### v7 
The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 

###### v8 
My son, listen to your father's instruction, and don't forsake your mother's teaching: 

###### v9 
for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck. 

###### v10 
My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent. 

###### v11 
If they say, "Come with us. Let's lie in wait for blood. Let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. 

###### v12 
Let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit. 

###### v13 
We'll find all valuable wealth. We'll fill our houses with plunder. 

###### v14 
You shall cast your lot among us. We'll all have one purse." 

###### v15 
My son, don't walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path, 

###### v16 
for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood. 

###### v17 
For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird; 

###### v18 
but these lay in wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives. 

###### v19 
So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners. 

###### v20 
Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares. 

###### v21 
She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: 

###### v22 
"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge? 

###### v23 
Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you. 

###### v24 
Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; 

###### v25 
but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof; 

###### v26 
I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you, 

###### v27 
when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come on you. 

###### v28 
Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me, 

###### v29 
because they hated knowledge, and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh. 

###### v30 
They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof. 

###### v31 
Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes. 

###### v32 
For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them. 

###### v33 
But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm."
