###### v1 
My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my commandments within you, 

###### v2 
so as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding; 

###### v3 
yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding; 

###### v4 
if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures: 

###### v5 
then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God. 

###### v6 
For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. 

###### v7 
He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 

###### v8 
that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his saints. 

###### v9 
Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path. 

###### v10 
For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 

###### v11 
Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you, 

###### v12 
to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things, 

###### v13 
who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness, 

###### v14 
who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil, 

###### v15 
who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths, 

###### v16 
to deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words, 

###### v17 
who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God; 

###### v18 
for her house leads down to death, her paths to the departed spirits. 

###### v19 
None who go to her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life. 

###### v20 
So you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 

###### v21 
For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it. 

###### v22 
But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
