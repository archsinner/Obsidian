###### v1 
My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding, 

###### v2 
that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge. 

###### v3 
For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil, 

###### v4 
but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword. 

###### v5 
Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol. 

###### v6 
She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn't know it. 

###### v7 
Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don't depart from the words of my mouth. 

###### v8 
Remove your way far from her. Don't come near the door of her house, 

###### v9 
lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one; 

###### v10 
lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man's house. 

###### v11 
You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed, 

###### v12 
and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. 

###### v13 
I haven't obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me! 

###### v14 
I have come to the brink of utter ruin, among the gathered assembly." 

###### v15 
Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well. 

###### v16 
Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares? 

###### v17 
Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you. 

###### v18 
Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 

###### v19 
A loving doe and a graceful deer-- let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love. 

###### v20 
For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another? 

###### v21 
For the ways of man are before Yahweh's eyes. He examines all his paths. 

###### v22 
The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly. 

###### v23 
He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.
