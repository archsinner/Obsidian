###### v1 
My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger, 

###### v2 
you are trapped by the words of your mouth; you are ensnared with the words of your mouth. 

###### v3 
Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor. 

###### v4 
Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids. 

###### v5 
Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler. 

###### v6 
Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise; 

###### v7 
which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 

###### v8 
provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest. 

###### v9 
How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep? 

###### v10 
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 

###### v11 
so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man. 

###### v12 
A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth, 

###### v13 
who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers, 

###### v14 
in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord. 

###### v15 
Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy. 

###### v16 
There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him: 

###### v17 
arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, 

###### v18 
a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief, 

###### v19 
a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers. 

###### v20 
My son, keep your father's commandment, and don't forsake your mother's teaching. 

###### v21 
Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck. 

###### v22 
When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you. 

###### v23 
For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, 

###### v24 
to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue. 

###### v25 
Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids. 

###### v26 
For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life. 

###### v27 
Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned? 

###### v28 
Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? 

###### v29 
So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished. 

###### v30 
Men don't despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry; 

###### v31 
but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house. 

###### v32 
He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul. 

###### v33 
He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away. 

###### v34 
For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won't spare in the day of vengeance. 

###### v35 
He won't regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
