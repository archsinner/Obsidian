###### v1 
My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you. 

###### v2 
Keep my commandments and live! Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye. 

###### v3 
Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart. 

###### v4 
Tell wisdom, "You are my sister." Call understanding your relative, 

###### v5 
that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words. 

###### v6 
For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice. 

###### v7 
I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, 

###### v8 
passing through the street near her corner, he went the way to her house, 

###### v9 
in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness. 

###### v10 
Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, and with crafty intent. 

###### v11 
She is loud and defiant. Her feet don't stay in her house. 

###### v12 
Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking at every corner. 

###### v13 
So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him: 

###### v14 
"Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. Today I have paid my vows. 

###### v15 
Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face, and I have found you. 

###### v16 
I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. 

###### v17 
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

###### v18 
Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning. Let's solace ourselves with loving. 

###### v19 
For my husband isn't at home. He has gone on a long journey. 

###### v20 
He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon." 

###### v21 
With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him. 

###### v22 
He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, as a fool stepping into a noose. 

###### v23 
Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries to the snare, and doesn't know that it will cost his life. 

###### v24 
Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth. 

###### v25 
Don't let your heart turn to her ways. Don't go astray in her paths, 

###### v26 
for she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty army. 

###### v27 
Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.
