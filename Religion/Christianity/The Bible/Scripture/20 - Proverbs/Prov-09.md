###### v1 
Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars. 

###### v2 
She has prepared her meat. She has mixed her wine. She has also set her table. 

###### v3 
She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city: 

###### v4 
"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, 

###### v5 
"Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed! 

###### v6 
Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding." 

###### v7 
One who corrects a mocker invites insult. One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse. 

###### v8 
Don't reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a wise person, and he will love you. 

###### v9 
Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser. Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.

The foolish woman is loud, undisciplined, and knows nothing. 

###### v14 
She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 

###### v15 
to call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways, 

###### v16 
"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here." as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, 

###### v17 
"Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant." 

###### v18 
But he doesn't know that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
