###### v1 
Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. 

###### v2 
It isn't good to have zeal without knowledge, nor being hasty with one's feet and missing the way. 

###### v3 
The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart rages against Yahweh. 

###### v4 
Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend. 

###### v5 
A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go free. 

###### v6 
Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. 

###### v7 
All the relatives of the poor shun him: how much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone. 

###### v8 
He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good. 

###### v9 
A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who utters lies shall perish. 

###### v10 
Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

###### v11 
The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. It is his glory to overlook an offense. 

###### v12 
The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 

###### v13 
A foolish son is the calamity of his father. A wife's quarrels are a continual dripping.

House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.

Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger.

He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. 

###### v17 
He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him. 

###### v18 
Discipline your son, for there is hope; don't be a willing party to his death. 

###### v19 
A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you must do it again. 

###### v20 
Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end. 

###### v21 
There are many plans in a man's heart, but Yahweh's counsel will prevail. 

###### v22 
That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. A poor man is better than a liar. 

###### v23 
The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests and will not be touched by trouble. 

###### v24 
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

###### v25 
Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge. 

###### v26 
He who robs his father and drives away his mother is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 

###### v27 
If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge. 

###### v28 
A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. 

###### v29 
Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
