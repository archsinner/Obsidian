###### v1 
When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you; 

###### v2 
put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite. 

###### v3 
Don't be desirous of his dainties, since they are deceitful food. 

###### v4 
Don't weary yourself to be rich. In your wisdom, show restraint. 

###### v5 
Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky. 

###### v6 
Don't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don't crave his delicacies: 

###### v7 
for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 

###### v8 
The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose your good words. 

###### v9 
Don't speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. 

###### v10 
Don't move the ancient boundary stone. Don't encroach on the fields of the fatherless, 

###### v11 
for their Defender is strong. He will plead their case against you. 

###### v12 
Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.

My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine. 

###### v16 
Yes, my heart will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. 

###### v17 
Don't let your heart envy sinners, but rather fear Yahweh all day long. 

###### v18 
Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not be cut off. 

###### v19 
Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path! 

###### v20 
Don't be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat: 

###### v21 
for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; and drowsiness clothes them in rags. 

###### v22 
Listen to your father who gave you life, and don't despise your mother when she is old. 

###### v23 
Buy the truth, and don't sell it. Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding. 

###### v24 
The father of the righteous has great joy. Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him. 

###### v25 
Let your father and your mother be glad! Let her who bore you rejoice! 

###### v26 
My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways. 

###### v27 
For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is a narrow well. 

###### v28 
Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the unfaithful among men. 

###### v29 
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? 

###### v30 
Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek out mixed wine. 

###### v31 
Don't look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly. 

###### v32 
In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper. 

###### v33 
Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will imagine confusing things. 

###### v34 
Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he who lies on top of the rigging: 

###### v35 
"They hit me, and I was not hurt! They beat me, and I don't feel it! When will I wake up? I can do it again. I can find another."
