###### v1 
Don't boast about tomorrow; for you don't know what a day may bring. 

###### v2 
Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips. 

###### v3 
A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool's provocation is heavier than both. 

###### v4 
Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able to stand before jealousy? 

###### v5 
Better is open rebuke than hidden love. 

###### v6 
The wounds of a friend are faithful, although the kisses of an enemy are profuse. 

###### v7 
A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. 

###### v8 
As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his home. 

###### v9 
Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest counsel from a man's friend. 

###### v10 
Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend. Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster. A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother. 

###### v11 
Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can answer my tormentor. 

###### v12 
A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.

Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. Hold it for a wayward woman! 

###### v14 
He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse by him. 

###### v15 
A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike: 

###### v16 
restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping oil in his right hand. 

###### v17 
Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend's countenance. 

###### v18 
Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored. 

###### v19 
Like water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man. 

###### v20 
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man's eyes are never satisfied. 

###### v21 
The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but man is refined by his praise. 

###### v22 
Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, yet his foolishness will not be removed from him. 

###### v23 
Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds: 

###### v24 
for riches are not forever, nor does the crown endure to all generations. 

###### v25 
The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses of the hills are gathered in. 

###### v26 
The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of a field. 

###### v27 
There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, for your family's food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
