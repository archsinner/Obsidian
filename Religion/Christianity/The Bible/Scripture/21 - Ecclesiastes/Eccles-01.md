###### v1 
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem: 

###### v2 
"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." 

###### v3 
What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun? 

###### v4 
One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever. 

###### v5 
The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises. 

###### v6 
The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses. 

###### v7 
All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again. 

###### v8 
All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 

###### v9 
That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 

###### v10 
Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us. 

###### v11 
There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after. 

###### v12 
I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 

###### v13 
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. 

###### v14 
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind. 

###### v15 
That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is lacking can't be counted. 

###### v16 
I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge." 

###### v17 
I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind. 

###### v18 
For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
