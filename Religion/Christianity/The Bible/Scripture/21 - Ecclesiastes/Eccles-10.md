###### v1 
Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor. 

###### v2 
A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left. 

###### v3 
Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool. 

###### v4 
If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don't leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest. 

###### v5 
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler. 

###### v6 
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place. 

###### v7 
I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth. 

###### v8 
He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 

###### v9 
Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it. 

###### v10 
If the ax is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success. 

###### v11 
If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer's tongue. 

###### v12 
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips. 

###### v13 
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 

###### v14 
A fool also multiplies words. Man doesn't know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him? 

###### v15 
The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't know how to go to the city. 

###### v16 
Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning! 

###### v17 
Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 

###### v18 
By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks. 

###### v19 
A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things. 

###### v20 
Don't curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don't curse the rich in your bedroom: for a bird of the sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.
