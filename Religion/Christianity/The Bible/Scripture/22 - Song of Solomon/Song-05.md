###### v1 
I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved. 

###### v2 
I was asleep, but my heart was awake. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night." 

###### v3 
I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them? 

###### v4 
My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. My heart pounded for him. 

###### v5 
I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock. 

###### v6 
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left, and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke. I looked for him, but I didn't find him. I called him, but he didn't answer. 

###### v7 
The watchmen who go about the city found me. They beat me. They bruised me. The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me. 

###### v8 
I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am faint with love. 

###### v9 
How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest among women? How is your beloved better than another beloved, that you do so adjure us? 

###### v10 
My beloved is white and ruddy. The best among ten thousand. 

###### v11 
His head is like the purest gold. His hair is bushy, black as a raven. 

###### v12 
His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk, mounted like jewels. 

###### v13 
His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. 

###### v14 
His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires. 

###### v15 
His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. 

###### v16 
His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
