###### v8

###### v9 
They will come with weeping. I will lead them with petitions. I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they won't stumble; for I am a father to Israel. Ephraim is my firstborn. 

###### v10 
"Hear Yahweh's word, you nations, and declare it in the distant islands. Say, 'He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.'

###### v12 
They will come and sing in the height of Zion, and will flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, to the new wine, to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd. Their soul will be as a watered garden. They will not sorrow any more at all. 

###### v13

Yahweh says: "Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work will be rewarded," says Yahweh. "They will come again from the land of the enemy. 

###### v17 
There is hope for your latter end," says Yahweh. "Your children will come again to their own territory. 

###### v18 
"I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus, 'You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as an untrained calf. Turn me, and I will be turned; for you are Yahweh my God. 

###### v19 
Surely after that I was turned. I repented. After that I was instructed. I struck my thigh. I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.' 

###### v20 
Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I still earnestly remember him. therefore my heart yearns for him. I will surely have mercy on him," says Yahweh. 

###### v21 
"Set up road signs. Make guideposts. Set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went. Turn again, virgin of Israel. Turn again to these your cities. 

###### v22

###### v23 
Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: "Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I reverse their captivity: 'Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.' 

###### v24 
Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks. 

###### v25 
For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul."

"Behold, the days come," says Yahweh, "that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal. 

###### v28 
It will happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant," says Yahweh. 

###### v29 
"In those days they will say no more, "'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'

###### v31

###### v32 
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them," says Yahweh. 

###### v33 
"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days," says Yahweh: "I will put my law in their inward parts, and I will write it in their heart. I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 

###### v34
