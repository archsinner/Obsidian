###### v1 
In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 

###### v2 
"Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. 

###### v3 
It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin." 

###### v4 
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh's words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book. 

###### v5 
Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, "I am restricted. I can't go into Yahweh's house. 

###### v6 
Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh's words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh's house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities. 

###### v7 
It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people." 

###### v8 
Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh's words in Yahweh's house. 

###### v9 
Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh. 

###### v10 
Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh's house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's house, in the ears of all the people. 

###### v11 
When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh's words, 

###### v12 
he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 

###### v13 
Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 

###### v14 
Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them. 

###### v15 
They said to him, "Sit down now, and read it in our hearing." So Baruch read it in their hearing. 

###### v16 
Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, "We will surely tell the king of all these words." 

###### v17 
They asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?" 

###### v18 
Then Baruch answered them, "He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book." 

###### v19 
Then the princes said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah go hide. Don't let anyone know where you are." 

###### v20 
They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king. 

###### v21 
So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. 

###### v22 
Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month; and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him. 

###### v23 
When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 

###### v24 
The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn't tear their garments. 

###### v25 
Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. 

###### v26 
The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them. 

###### v27 
Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 

###### v28 
"Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. 

###### v29 
Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Yahweh says: "You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written therein, saying, 'The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?'"' 

###### v30 
Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: "He will have no one to sit on David's throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 

###### v31 
I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn't listen."'" 

###### v32 
Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
