###### v1 
Of the children of Ammon. Yahweh says: "Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why then does Malcam possess Gad, and his people dwell in its cities? 

###### v2 
Therefore behold, the days come," says Yahweh, "that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it will become a desolate heap, and her daughters will be burned with fire: then Israel will possess those who possessed him," says Yahweh. 

###### v3

Flee! Turn back! Dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him when I visit him. 

###### v9 
If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves came by night, wouldn't they steal until they had enough?

###### v15 
"For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men. 

###### v16 
As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill, though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there," says Yahweh. 

###### v17 
"Edom will become an astonishment. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished, and will hiss at all its plagues. 

###### v18 
As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbor cities," says Yahweh, "no man will dwell there, neither will any son of man live therein. 

###### v19 
"Behold, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, I will appoint him over it. For who is like me? Who will appoint me a time? Who is the shepherd who will stand before me?" 

###### v20 
Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they will drag them away, the little ones of the flock. Surely he will make their habitation desolate over them. 

###### v21 
The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea. 

###### v22
