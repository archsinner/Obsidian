###### v1 
I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 

###### v2 
He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light. 

###### v3 
Surely he turns his hand against me again and again all day long. 

###### v4 
He has made my flesh and my skin old. He has broken my bones. 

###### v5 
He has built against me, and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. 

###### v6 
He has made me dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead. 

###### v7 
He has walled me about, so that I can't go out. He has made my chain heavy. 

###### v8 
Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer. 

###### v9 
He has walled up my ways with cut stone. He has made my paths crooked. 

###### v10 
He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places. 

###### v11 
He has turned away my ways, and pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate. 

###### v12 
He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 

###### v13 
He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. 

###### v14 
I have become a derision to all my people, and their song all day long. 

###### v15 
He has filled me with bitterness. He has stuffed me with wormwood. 

###### v16 
He has also broken my teeth with gravel. He has covered me with ashes. 

###### v17 
You have removed my soul far away from peace. I forgot prosperity. 

###### v18 
I said, "My strength has perished, along with my expectation from Yahweh." 

###### v19 
Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the bitterness. 

###### v20 
My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me. 

###### v21 
This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope. 

###### v22 
It is because of Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassion doesn't fail. 

###### v23 
They are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness. 

###### v24 
"Yahweh is my portion," says my soul. "Therefore I will hope in him." 

###### v25 
Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. 

###### v26 
It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. 

###### v27 
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

###### v28 
Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him. 

###### v29 
Let him put his mouth in the dust, if it is so that there may be hope. 

###### v30 
Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. Let him be filled full of reproach. 

###### v31 
For the Lord will not cast off forever. 

###### v32 
For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. 

###### v33 
For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. 

###### v34 
To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, 

###### v35 
to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High, 

###### v36 
to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn't approve. 

###### v37 
Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn't command it? 

###### v38 
Doesn't evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? 

###### v39 
Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 

###### v40 
Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh. 

###### v41 
Let's lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens. 

###### v42 
"We have transgressed and have rebelled. You have not pardoned. 

###### v43 
"You have covered us with anger and pursued us. You have killed. You have not pitied. 

###### v44 
You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through. 

###### v45 
You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the middle of the peoples. 

###### v46 
"All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. 

###### v47 
Terror and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction." 

###### v48 
My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### v49 
My eye pours down and doesn't cease, without any intermission, 

###### v50 
until Yahweh looks down, and sees from heaven. 

###### v51 
My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. 

###### v52 
They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause. 

###### v53 
They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me. 

###### v54 
Waters flowed over my head. I said, "I am cut off." 

###### v55 
I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon. 

###### v56 
You heard my voice: "Don't hide your ear from my sighing, and my cry." 

###### v57 
You came near in the day that I called on you. You said, "Don't be afraid." 

###### v58 
Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. You have redeemed my life. 

###### v59 
Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause. 

###### v60 
You have seen all their vengeance and all their plans against me. 

###### v61 
You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their plans against me, 

###### v62 
the lips of those that rose up against me, and their plots against me all day long. 

###### v63 
You see their sitting down and their rising up. I am their song. 

###### v64 
You will pay them back, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands. 

###### v65 
You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them. 

###### v66 
You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.
