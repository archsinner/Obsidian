###### v1 
Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us. Look, and see our reproach. 

###### v2 
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to aliens. 

###### v3 
We are orphans and fatherless. Our mothers are as widows. 

###### v4 
We have drunken our water for money. Our wood is sold to us. 

###### v5 
Our pursuers are on our necks. We are weary, and have no rest. 

###### v6 
We have given our hands to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

###### v7 
Our fathers sinned, and are no more. We have borne their iniquities. 

###### v8 
Servants rule over us. There is no one to deliver us out of their hand. 

###### v9 
We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness. 

###### v10 
Our skin is black like an oven, because of the burning heat of famine. 

###### v11 
They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah.

The young men carry millstones. The children stumbled under loads of wood. 

###### v14 
The elders have ceased from the gate, and the young men from their music. 

###### v15 
The joy of our heart has ceased. Our dance is turned into mourning. 

###### v16 
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 

###### v17 
For this our heart is faint. For these things our eyes are dim: 

###### v18 
for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. The foxes walk on it. 

###### v19 
You, Yahweh, remain forever. Your throne is from generation to generation. 

###### v20 
Why do you forget us forever, and forsake us for so long a time? 

###### v21 
Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned. Renew our days as of old. 

###### v22 
But you have utterly rejected us. You are very angry against us.
