###### v1 
"Listen to this, you priests! Listen, house of Israel, and give ear, house of the king! For the judgment is against you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor. 

###### v2 
The rebels are deep in slaughter; but I discipline all of them. 

###### v3 
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute. Israel is defiled. 

###### v4 
Their deeds won't allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and they don't know Yahweh. 

###### v5 
The pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. Judah also will stumble with them. 

###### v6 
They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they won't find him. He has withdrawn himself from them. 

###### v7 
They are unfaithful to Yahweh; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their fields. 

###### v8 
"Blow the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin! 

###### v9 
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be. 

###### v10 
The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark. I will pour out my wrath on them like water. 

###### v11 
Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols. 

###### v12 
Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, and to the house of Judah like rottenness. 

###### v13 
"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound. 

###### v14 
For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I myself will tear in pieces and go away. I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver. 

###### v15 
I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly."
