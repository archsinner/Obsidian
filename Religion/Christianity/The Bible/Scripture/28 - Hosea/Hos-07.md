###### v1 
When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, also the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the gang of robbers ravages outside. 

###### v2 
They don't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own deeds have engulfed them. They are before my face. 

###### v3 
They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 

###### v4 
They are all adulterers. They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring, from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened. 

###### v5 
On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He joined his hand with mockers. 

###### v6 
For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all the night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire. 

###### v7 
They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one among them who calls to me. 

###### v8 
Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations. Ephraim is a pancake not turned over. 

###### v9 
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he doesn't realize it. Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he doesn't realize it. 

###### v10 
The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they haven't returned to Yahweh their God, nor sought him, for all this. 

###### v11 
"Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria. 

###### v12 
When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard. 

###### v13 
Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 

###### v14 
They haven't cried to me with their heart, but they howl on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They turn away from me. 

###### v15 
Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil against me. 

###### v16 
They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
