###### v1 
Don't rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations; for you were unfaithful to your God. You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor. 

###### v2 
The threshing floor and the wine press won't feed them, and the new wine will fail her. 

###### v3 
They won't dwell in Yahweh's land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria. 

###### v4 
They won't pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into Yahweh's house. 

###### v5 
What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh? 

###### v6 
For, behold, when they flee destruction, Egypt will gather them up. Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver. Thorns will be in their tents. 

###### v7 
The days of visitation have come. The days of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool, and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of your sins, and because your hostility is great. 

###### v8 
A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God. A fowler's snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of his God. 

###### v9 
They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will punish them for their sins. 

###### v10 
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season; but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved. 

###### v11 
As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception. 

###### v12 
Though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left. Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them! 

###### v13 
I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer. 

###### v14 
Give them--Yahweh what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 

###### v15 
"All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house! I will love them no more. All their princes are rebels. 

###### v16 
Ephraim is struck. Their root has dried up. They will bear no fruit. Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb." 

###### v17 
My God will cast them away, because they didn't listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.
