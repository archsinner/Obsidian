###### v1 
"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 

###### v2 
They called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images. 

###### v3 
Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took them by his arms; but they didn't know that I healed them. 

###### v4 
I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; and I bent down to him and I fed him. 

###### v5 
"They won't return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian will be their king, because they refused to repent. 

###### v6 
The sword will fall on their cities, and will destroy the bars of their gates, and will put an end to their plans. 

###### v7 
My people are determined to turn from me. Though they call to the Most High, he certainly won't exalt them. 

###### v8 
"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me, my compassion is aroused. 

###### v9 
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One among you; and I will not come in wrath. 

###### v10 
They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west. 

###### v11 
They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will settle them in their houses," says Yahweh. 

###### v12 
Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. Judah still strays from God, and is unfaithful to the Holy One.
