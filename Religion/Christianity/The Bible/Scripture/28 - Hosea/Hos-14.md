###### v1 
Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen because of your sin. 

###### v2 
Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. Tell him, "Forgive all our sins, and accept that which is good: so we offer our lips like bulls. 

###### v3 
Assyria can't save us. We won't ride on horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, 'Our gods!' for in you the fatherless finds mercy." 

###### v4 
"I will heal their waywardness. I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him. 

###### v5 
I will be like the dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, and send down his roots like Lebanon. 

###### v6 
His branches will spread, and his beauty will be like the olive tree, and his fragrance like Lebanon. 

###### v7 
Men will dwell in his shade. They will revive like the grain, and blossom like the vine. Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon. 

###### v8 
Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? I answer, and will take care of him. I am like a green cypress tree; from me your fruit is found." 

###### v9 
Who is wise, that he may understand these things? Who is prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of Yahweh are right, and the righteous walk in them; But the rebellious stumble in them.
