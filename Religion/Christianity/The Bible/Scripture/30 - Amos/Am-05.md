###### v1 
Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel. 

###### v2 
"The virgin of Israel has fallen; She shall rise no more. She is cast down on her land; there is no one to raise her up." 

###### v3 
For the Lord Yahweh says: "The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel." 

###### v4 
For Yahweh says to the house of Israel: "Seek me, and you will live; 

###### v5 
but don't seek Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and don't pass to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing. 

###### v6 
Seek Yahweh, and you will live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel. 

###### v7 
You who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth: 

###### v8 
seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night; who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name, 

###### v9 
who brings sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the fortress. 

###### v10 
They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly. 

###### v11 
Therefore, because you trample on the poor, and take taxes from him of wheat: You have built houses of cut stone, but you will not dwell in them. You have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine. 

###### v12 
For I know how many are your offenses, and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the just, who take a bribe, and who turn away the needy in the courts. 

###### v13 
Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time, for it is an evil time. 

###### v14 
Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with you, as you say. 

###### v15 
Hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the courts. It may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph." 

###### v16 
Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord, says: "Wailing will be in all the wide ways; and they will say in all the streets, 'Alas! Alas!' and they will call the farmer to mourning, and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing. 

###### v17 
In all vineyards there will be wailing; for I will pass through the middle of you," says Yahweh. 

###### v18 
"Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh! Why do you long for the day of Yahweh? It is darkness, and not light. 

###### v19 
As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him. 

###### v20 
Won't the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it? 

###### v21 
I hate, I despise your feasts, and I can't stand your solemn assemblies. 

###### v22 
Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals. 

###### v23 
Take away from me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. 

###### v24 
But let justice roll on like rivers, and righteousness like a mighty stream. 

###### v25 
"Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel? 

###### v26 
You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves. 

###### v27 
Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus," says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies.
