###### v1 
Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish's belly. 

###### v2 
He said, "I called because of my affliction to Yahweh. He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried. You heard my voice. 

###### v3 
For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your billows passed over me. 

###### v4 
I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.' 

###### v5 
The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped around my head. 

###### v6 
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever: yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God. 

###### v7 
"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. 

###### v8 
Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 

###### v9 
But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh." 

###### v10 
Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
