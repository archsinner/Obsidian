###### v5 
Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies says: Consider your ways. 

###### v6 
You have sown much, and bring in little. You eat, but you don't have enough. You drink, but you aren't filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it." 

###### v7 
This is what Yahweh of Armies says: "Consider your ways.

###### v10 
Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.

I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground produces, on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands." 

###### v12 
Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed Yahweh, their God's voice, and the words of Haggai, the prophet, as Yahweh, their God, had sent him; and the people feared Yahweh.
