###### v1 
On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the seaside. 

###### v2 
Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach. 

###### v3 
He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a farmer went out to sow. 

###### v4 
As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them. 

###### v5 
Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth. 

###### v6 
When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away. 

###### v7 
Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them. 

###### v8 
Others fell on good soil and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. 

###### v9 
He who has ears to hear, let him hear." 

###### v10 
The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?" 

###### v11 
He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them. 

###### v12 
For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. 

###### v13 
Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see, and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand. 

###### v14 
In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, 'By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive; 

###### v15 
for this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.' 

###### v16 
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. 

###### v17 
For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them. 

###### v18 
"Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. 

###### v19 
When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside. 

###### v20 
What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it; 

###### v21 
yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles. 

###### v22 
What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. 

###### v23 
What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty." 

###### v24 
He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, 

###### v25 
but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away. 

###### v26 
But when the blade sprang up and produced grain, then the darnel weeds appeared also. 

###### v27 
The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?' 

###### v28 
"He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?' 

###### v29 
"But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them. 

###### v30 
Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'" 

###### v31 
He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took, and sowed in his field, 

###### v32 
which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches." 

###### v33 
He spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened." 

###### v34 
Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn't speak to them, 

###### v35 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world." 

###### v36 
Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field." 

###### v37 
He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, 

###### v38 
the field is the world, the good seeds are the children of the Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. 

###### v39 
The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. 

###### v40 
As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age. 

###### v41 
The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those who do iniquity, 

###### v42 
and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

###### v43 
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. 

###### v44 
"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. 

###### v45 
"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, 

###### v46 
who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. 

###### v47 
"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind, 

###### v48 
which, when it was filled, fishermen drew up on the beach. They sat down and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away. 

###### v49 
So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous, 

###### v50 
and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 

###### v51 
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord." 

###### v52 
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things." 

###### v53 
When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. 

###### v54 
Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? 

###### v55 
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? 

###### v56 
Aren't all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?" 

###### v57 
They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house." 

###### v58 
He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
