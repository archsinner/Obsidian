###### v1 
Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, 

###### v2 
"Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread." 

###### v3 
He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? 

###### v4 
For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' 

###### v5 
But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God," 

###### v6 
he shall not honor his father or mother.' You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. 

###### v7 
You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 

###### v8 
'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. 

###### v9 
And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'" 

###### v10 
He summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand. 

###### v11 
That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man." 

###### v12 
Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?" 

###### v13 
But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted. 

###### v14 
Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit." 

###### v15 
Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us." 

###### v16 
So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand? 

###### v17 
Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? 

###### v18 
But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. 

###### v19 
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. 

###### v20 
These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the man." 

###### v21 
Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. 

###### v22 
Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!" 

###### v23 
But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us." 

###### v24 
But he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel." 

###### v25 
But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me." 

###### v26 
But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." 

###### v27 
But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." 

###### v28 
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. 

###### v29 
Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain and sat there. 

###### v30 
Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, 

###### v31 
so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel. 

###### v32 
Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way." 

###### v33 
The disciples said to him, "Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?" 

###### v34 
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish." 

###### v35 
He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; 

###### v36 
and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 

###### v37 
They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. 

###### v38 
Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. 

###### v39 
Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
