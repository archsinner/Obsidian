###### v1 
"Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 

###### v2 
Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 

###### v3 
Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, 

###### v4 
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 

###### v5 
Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. 

###### v6 
But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!' 

###### v7 
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 

###### v8 
The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' 

###### v9 
But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.' 

###### v10 
While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. 

###### v11 
Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.' 

###### v12 
But he answered, 'Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.' 

###### v13 
Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming. 

###### v14 
"For it is like a man going into another country, who called his own servants and entrusted his goods to them. 

###### v15 
To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. 

###### v16 
Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. 

###### v17 
In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two. 

###### v18 
But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money. 

###### v19 
"Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and settled accounts with them. 

###### v20 
He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents in addition to them.' 

###### v21 
"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.' 

###### v22 
"He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents in addition to them.' 

###### v23 
"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things. I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.' 

###### v24 
"He also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you didn't sow, and gathering where you didn't scatter. 

###### v25 
I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.' 

###### v26 
"But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I didn't scatter. 

###### v27 
You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest. 

###### v28 
Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 

###### v29 
For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away. 

###### v30 
Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 

###### v31 
"But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. 

###### v32 
Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 

###### v33 
He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 

###### v34 
Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; 

###### v35 
for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. 

###### v36 
I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.' 

###### v37 
"Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink? 

###### v38 
When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you? 

###### v39 
When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?' 

###### v40 
"The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' 

###### v41 
Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels; 

###### v42 
for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; 

###### v43 
I was a stranger, and you didn't take me in; naked, and you didn't clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn't visit me.' 

###### v44 
"Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?' 

###### v45 
"Then he will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell you, because you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you didn't do it to me.' 

###### v46 
These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
