###### v1 
When Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples, 

###### v2 
"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified." 

###### v3 
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. 

###### v4 
They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit and kill him. 

###### v5 
But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people." 

###### v6 
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 

###### v7 
a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table. 

###### v8 
But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste? 

###### v9 
For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor." 

###### v10 
However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me. 

###### v11 
For you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have me. 

###### v12 
For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 

###### v13 
Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her." 

###### v14 
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 

###### v15 
and said, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?" So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. 

###### v16 
From that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 

###### v17 
Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?" 

###### v18 
He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'" 

###### v19 
The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. 

###### v20 
Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. 

###### v21 
As they were eating, he said, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me." 

###### v22 
They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It isn't me, is it, Lord?" 

###### v23 
He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me. 

###### v24 
The Son of Man goes even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born." 

###### v25 
Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You said it." 

###### v26 
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my body." 

###### v27 
He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of you drink it, 

###### v28 
for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. 

###### v29 
But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom." 

###### v30 
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 

###### v31 
Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' 

###### v32 
But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee." 

###### v33 
But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble." 

###### v34 
Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." 

###### v35 
Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise. 

###### v36 
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray." 

###### v37 
He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled. 

###### v38 
Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me." 

###### v39 
He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire." 

###### v40 
He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour? 

###### v41 
Watch and pray, that you don't enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." 

###### v42 
Again, a second time he went away and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done." 

###### v43 
He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 

###### v44 
He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. 

###### v45 
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

###### v46 
Arise, let's be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand." 

###### v47 
While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 

###### v48 
Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him." 

###### v49 
Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him. 

###### v50 
Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 

###### v51 
Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 

###### v52 
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. 

###### v53 
Or do you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? 

###### v54 
How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?" 

###### v55 
In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. 

###### v56 
But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. 

###### v57 
Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 

###### v58 
But Peter followed him from a distance to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end. 

###### v59 
Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death, 

###### v60 
and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward 

###### v61 
and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'" 

###### v62 
The high priest stood up and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?" 

###### v63 
But Jesus stayed silent. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God." 

###### v64 
Jesus said to him, "You have said so. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky." 

###### v65 
Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. 

###### v66 
What do you think?" They answered, "He is worthy of death!" 

###### v67 
Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, 

###### v68 
saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?" 

###### v69 
Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!" 

###### v70 
But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you are talking about." 

###### v71 
When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth." 

###### v72 
Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man." 

###### v73 
After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known." 

###### v74 
Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!" Immediately the rooster crowed. 

###### v75 
Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Then he went out and wept bitterly.
