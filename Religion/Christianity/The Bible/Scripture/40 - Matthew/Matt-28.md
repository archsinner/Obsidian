###### v1 
Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 

###### v2 
Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. 

###### v3 
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 

###### v4 
For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. 

###### v5 
The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. 

###### v6 
He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. 

###### v7 
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you." 

###### v8 
They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 

###### v9 
As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. 

###### v10 
Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me." 

###### v11 
Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. 

###### v12 
When they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, 

###### v13 
saying, "Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. 

###### v14 
If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry." 

###### v15 
So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today. 

###### v16 
But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them. 

###### v17 
When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted. 

###### v18 
Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. 

###### v19 
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 

###### v20 
teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.
