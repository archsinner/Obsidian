###### v1 
The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

###### v2 
As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you: 

###### v3 
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!'" 

###### v4 
John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. 

###### v5 
All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. 

###### v6 
John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. 

###### v7 
He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. 

###### v8 
I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit." 

###### v9 
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 

###### v10 
Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 

###### v11 
A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." 

###### v12 
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. 

###### v13 
He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him. 

###### v14 
Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God's Kingdom, 

###### v15 
and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and God's Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News." 

###### v16 
Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 

###### v17 
Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men." 

###### v18 
Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. 

###### v19 
Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. 

###### v20 
Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. 

###### v21 
They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 

###### v22 
They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. 

###### v23 
Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 

###### v24 
saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!" 

###### v25 
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" 

###### v26 
The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 

###### v27 
They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!" 

###### v28 
The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area. 

###### v29 
Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

###### v30 
Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. 

###### v31 
He came and took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her immediately, and she served them. 

###### v32 
At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons. 

###### v33 
All the city was gathered together at the door. 

###### v34 
He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him. 

###### v35 
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. 

###### v36 
Simon and those who were with him searched for him. 

###### v37 
They found him and told him, "Everyone is looking for you." 

###### v38 
He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason." 

###### v39 
He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. 

###### v40 
A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean." 

###### v41 
Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean." 

###### v42 
When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean. 

###### v43 
He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out, 

###### v44 
and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." 

###### v45 
But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere.
