###### v1 
When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home. 

###### v2 
Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. 

###### v3 
Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. 

###### v4 
When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. 

###### v5 
Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you." 

###### v6 
But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 

###### v7 
"Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 

###### v8 
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these things in your hearts? 

###### v9 
Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?' 

###### v10 
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic-- 

###### v11 
"I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house." 

###### v12 
He arose, and immediately took up the mat and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!" 

###### v13 
He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. 

###### v14 
As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. He said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him. 

###### v15 
He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. 

###### v16 
The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?" 

###### v17 
When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." 

###### v18 
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?" 

###### v19 
Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast. 

###### v20 
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. 

###### v21 
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made. 

###### v22 
No one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins." 

###### v23 
He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. 

###### v24 
The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?" 

###### v25 
He said to them, "Did you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry--he, and those who were with him? 

###### v26 
How he entered into God's house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?" 

###### v27 
He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 

###### v28 
Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
