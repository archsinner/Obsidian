###### v1 
He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. 

###### v2 
When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands? 

###### v3 
Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" So they were offended at him. 

###### v4 
Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house." 

###### v5 
He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them. 

###### v6 
He marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching. 

###### v7 
He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 

###### v8 
He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, 

###### v9 
but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics. 

###### v10 
He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there. 

###### v11 
Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!" 

###### v12 
They went out and preached that people should repent. 

###### v13 
They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them. 

###### v14 
King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him." 

###### v15 
But others said, "He is Elijah." Others said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets." 

###### v16 
But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead." 

###### v17 
For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her. 

###### v18 
For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." 

###### v19 
Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn't, 

###### v20 
for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly. 

###### v21 
Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee. 

###### v22 
When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you." 

###### v23 
He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom." 

###### v24 
She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" She said, "The head of John the Baptizer." 

###### v25 
She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter." 

###### v26 
The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her. 

###### v27 
Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 

###### v28 
and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother. 

###### v29 
When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. 

###### v30 
The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught. 

###### v31 
He said to them, "You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 

###### v32 
They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. 

###### v33 
They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him. 

###### v34 
Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. 

###### v35 
When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, "This place is deserted, and it is late in the day. 

###### v36 
Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat." 

###### v37 
But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?" 

###### v38 
He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go see." When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish." 

###### v39 
He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. 

###### v40 
They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties. 

###### v41 
He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all. 

###### v42 
They all ate, and were filled. 

###### v43 
They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. 

###### v44 
Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. 

###### v45 
Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. 

###### v46 
After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray. 

###### v47 
When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. 

###### v48 
Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea,  and he would have passed by them, 

###### v49 
but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out; 

###### v50 
for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid." 

###### v51 
He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled; 

###### v52 
for they hadn't understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. 

###### v53 
When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. 

###### v54 
When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him, 

###### v55 
and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was. 

###### v56 
Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.
