###### v1 
Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. 

###### v2 
Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault. 

###### v3 
(For the Pharisees and all the Jews don't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. 

###### v4 
They don't eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) 

###### v5 
The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?" 

###### v6 
He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 

###### v7 
But they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' 

###### v8 
"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things." 

###### v9 
He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. 

###### v10 
For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;' 

###### v11 
But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,"'" that is to say, given to God, 

###### v12 
"then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother, 

###### v13 
making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. You do many things like this." 

###### v14 
He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand. 

###### v15 
There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. 

###### v16 
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!" 

###### v17 
When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable. 

###### v18 
He said to them, "Are you also without understanding? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him, 

###### v19 
because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?" 

###### v20 
He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. 

###### v21 
For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, 

###### v22 
covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. 

###### v23 
All these evil things come from within, and defile the man." 

###### v24 
From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice. 

###### v25 
For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. 

###### v26 
Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. 

###### v27 
But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." 

###### v28 
But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 

###### v29 
He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter." 

###### v30 
She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out. 

###### v31 
Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis. 

###### v32 
They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. 

###### v33 
He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue. 

###### v34 
Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!" 

###### v35 
Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. 

###### v36 
He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. 

###### v37 
They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"
