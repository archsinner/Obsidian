###### v1 
He began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country. 

###### v2 
When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard. 

###### v3 
They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty. 

###### v4 
Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. 

###### v5 
Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some. 

###### v6 
Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 

###### v7 
But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 

###### v8 
They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. 

###### v9 
What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. 

###### v10 
Haven't you even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected was made the head of the corner. 

###### v11 
This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes'?" 

###### v12 
They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away. 

###### v13 
They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. 

###### v14 
When they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? 

###### v15 
Shall we give, or shall we not give?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it." 

###### v16 
They brought it. He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?" They said to him, "Caesar's." 

###### v17 
Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." They marveled greatly at him. 

###### v18 
Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying, 

###### v19 
"Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.' 

###### v20 
There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. 

###### v21 
The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; 

###### v22 
and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. 

###### v23 
In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife." 

###### v24 
Jesus answered them, "Isn't this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God? 

###### v25 
For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 

###### v26 
But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? 

###### v27 
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken." 

###### v28 
One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the greatest of all?" 

###### v29 
Jesus answered, "The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one: 

###### v30 
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment. 

###### v31 
The second is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these." 

###### v32 
The scribe said to him, "Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he, 

###### v33 
and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." 

###### v34 
When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from God's Kingdom." No one dared ask him any question after that. 

###### v35 
Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? 

###### v36 
For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."' 

###### v37 
Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?" The common people heard him gladly. 

###### v38 
In his teaching he said to them, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces, 

###### v39 
and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts: 

###### v40 
those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation." 

###### v41 
Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. 

###### v42 
A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin. 

###### v43 
He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury, 

###### v44 
for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."
