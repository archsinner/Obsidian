###### v1 
It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him. 

###### v2 
For they said, "Not during the feast, because there might be a riot among the people." 

###### v3 
While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head. 

###### v4 
But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted? 

###### v5 
For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." So they grumbled against her. 

###### v6 
But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me. 

###### v7 
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me. 

###### v8 
She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying. 

###### v9 
Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her." 

###### v10 
Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them. 

###### v11 
They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him. 

###### v12 
On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?" 

###### v13 
He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him, 

###### v14 
and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"' 

###### v15 
He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there." 

###### v16 
His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover. 

###### v17 
When it was evening he came with the twelve. 

###### v18 
As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me." 

###### v19 
They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, "Surely not I?" And another said, "Surely not I?" 

###### v20 
He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish. 

###### v21 
For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born." 

###### v22 
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body." 

###### v23 
He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. 

###### v24 
He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. 

###### v25 
Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in God's Kingdom." 

###### v26 
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 

###### v27 
Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' 

###### v28 
However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee." 

###### v29 
But Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended, yet I will not." 

###### v30 
Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." 

###### v31 
But he spoke all the more, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." They all said the same thing. 

###### v32 
They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray." 

###### v33 
He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. 

###### v34 
He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch." 

###### v35 
He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. 

###### v36 
He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire." 

###### v37 
He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you watch one hour? 

###### v38 
Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." 

###### v39 
Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. 

###### v40 
Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know what to answer him. 

###### v41 
He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

###### v42 
Arise! Let's get going. Behold: he who betrays me is at hand." 

###### v43 
Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 

###### v44 
Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely." 

###### v45 
When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi!" and kissed him. 

###### v46 
They laid their hands on him, and seized him. 

###### v47 
But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 

###### v48 
Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? 

###### v49 
I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled." 

###### v50 
They all left him, and fled. 

###### v51 
A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him, 

###### v52 
but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 

###### v53 
They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him. 

###### v54 
Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire. 

###### v55 
Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none. 

###### v56 
For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other. 

###### v57 
Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying, 

###### v58 
"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'" 

###### v59 
Even so, their testimony didn't agree. 

###### v60 
The high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?" 

###### v61 
But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" 

###### v62 
Jesus said, "I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky." 

###### v63 
The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need have we of witnesses? 

###### v64 
You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death. 

###### v65 
Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the palms of their hands. 

###### v66 
As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, 

###### v67 
and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!" 

###### v68 
But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you are saying." He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed. 

###### v69 
The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, "This is one of them." 

###### v70 
But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it." 

###### v71 
But he began to curse, and to swear, "I don't know this man of whom you speak!" 

###### v72 
The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." When he thought about that, he wept.
