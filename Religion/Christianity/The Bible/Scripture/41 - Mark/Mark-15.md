###### v1 
Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 

###### v2 
Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered, "So you say." 

###### v3 
The chief priests accused him of many things. 

###### v4 
Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!" 

###### v5 
But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled. 

###### v6 
Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. 

###### v7 
There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. 

###### v8 
The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them. 

###### v9 
Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" 

###### v10 
For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 

###### v11 
But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. 

###### v12 
Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 

###### v13 
They cried out again, "Crucify him!" 

###### v14 
Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!" 

###### v15 
Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified. 

###### v16 
The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. 

###### v17 
They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 

###### v18 
They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 

###### v19 
They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. 

###### v20 
When they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him. 

###### v21 
They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross. 

###### v22 
They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull." 

###### v23 
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn't take it. 

###### v24 
Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. 

###### v25 
It was the third hour, and they crucified him. 

###### v26 
The superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS." 

###### v27 
With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. 

###### v28 
The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was counted with transgressors." 

###### v29 
Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, 

###### v30 
save yourself, and come down from the cross!" 

###### v31 
Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can't save himself. 

###### v32 
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him also insulted him. 

###### v33 
When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 

###### v34 
At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" 

###### v35 
Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah." 

###### v36 
One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down." 

###### v37 
Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. 

###### v38 
The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. 

###### v39 
When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!" 

###### v40 
There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 

###### v41 
who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. 

###### v42 
When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 

###### v43 
Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God's Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. 

###### v44 
Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long. 

###### v45 
When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 

###### v46 
He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 

###### v47 
Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
