###### v1 
After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 

###### v2 
Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. 

###### v3 
His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. 

###### v4 
For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world." 

###### v5 
For even his brothers didn't believe in him. 

###### v6 
Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. 

###### v7 
The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. 

###### v8 
You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled." 

###### v9 
Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. 

###### v10 
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. 

###### v11 
The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?" 

###### v12 
There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray." 

###### v13 
Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. 

###### v14 
But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 

###### v15 
The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?" 

###### v16 
Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. 

###### v17 
If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself. 

###### v18 
He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 

###### v19 
Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?" 

###### v20 
The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?" 

###### v21 
Jesus answered them, "I did one work and you all marvel because of it. 

###### v22 
Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. 

###### v23 
If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? 

###### v24 
Don't judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment." 

###### v25 
Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn't this he whom they seek to kill? 

###### v26 
Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ? 

###### v27 
However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from." 

###### v28 
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don't know. 

###### v29 
I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me." 

###### v30 
They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. 

###### v31 
But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?" 

###### v32 
The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 

###### v33 
Then Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. 

###### v34 
You will seek me, and won't find me. You can't come where I am." 

###### v35 
The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we won't find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 

###### v36 
What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me;' and 'Where I am, you can't come'?" 

###### v37 
Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! 

###### v38 
He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water." 

###### v39 
But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified. 

###### v40 
Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet." 

###### v41 
Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? 

###### v42 
Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring of David,  the village where David was?" 

###### v43 
So a division arose in the multitude because of him. 

###### v44 
Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. 

###### v45 
The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why didn't you bring him?" 

###### v46 
The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!" 

###### v47 
The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also led astray, are you? 

###### v48 
Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees? 

###### v49 
But this multitude that doesn't know the law is cursed." 

###### v50 
Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them, 

###### v51 
"Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?" 

###### v52 
They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee." 

###### v53 
Everyone went to his own house,
