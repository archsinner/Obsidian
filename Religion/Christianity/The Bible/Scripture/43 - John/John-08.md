###### v1 
but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 

###### v2 
Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down and taught them. 

###### v3 
The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the middle, 

###### v4 
they told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. 

###### v5 
Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do you say about her?” 

###### v6 
They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of.

###### v7 
But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her." 

###### v8 
Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger. 

###### v9 
They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle. 

###### v10 
Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?" 

###### v11 
She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more." 

###### v12 
Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life." 

###### v13 
The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid." 

###### v14 
Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going. 

###### v15 
You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one. 

###### v16 
Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me. 

###### v17 
It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.

###### v18 
I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me." 

###### v19 
They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also." 

###### v20 
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. 

###### v21 
Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come." 

###### v22 
The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, because he says, 'Where I am going, you can't come'?" 

###### v23 
He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world. 

###### v24 
I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins." 

###### v25 
They said therefore to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning. 

###### v26 
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world." 

###### v27 
They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father. 

###### v28 
Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things. 

###### v29 
He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him." 

###### v30 
As he spoke these things, many believed in him. 

###### v31 
Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. 

###### v32 
You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." 

###### v33 
They answered him, "We are Abraham's offspring, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free'?" 

###### v34 
Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin. 

###### v35 
A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever. A son remains forever. 

###### v36 
If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. 

###### v37 
I know that you are Abraham's offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. 

###### v38 
I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father." 

###### v39 
They answered him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham. 

###### v40 
But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do this. 

###### v41 
You do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God." 

###### v42 
Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me. 

###### v43 
Why don't you understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word. 

###### v44 
You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies. 

###### v45 
But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me. 

###### v46 
Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? 

###### v47 
He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God." 

###### v48 
Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?" 

###### v49 
Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. 

###### v50 
But I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. 

###### v51 
Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death." 

###### v52 
Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.' 

###### v53 
Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?" 

###### v54 
Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. 

###### v55 
You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him and keep his word. 

###### v56 
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad." 

###### v57 
The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?" 

###### v58 
Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM." 

###### v59 
Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.
