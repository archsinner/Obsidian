###### v1 
As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. 

###### v2 
His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" 

###### v3 
Jesus answered, "This man didn't sin, nor did his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. 

###### v4 
I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. 

###### v5 
While I am in the world, I am the light of the world." 

###### v6 
When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud, 

###### v7 
and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. 

###### v8 
The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, "Isn't this he who sat and begged?" 

###### v9 
Others were saying, "It is he." Still others were saying, "He looks like him." He said, "I am he." 

###### v10 
They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?" 

###### v11 
He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight." 

###### v12 
Then they asked him, "Where is he?" He said, "I don't know." 

###### v13 
They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees. 

###### v14 
It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. 

###### v15 
Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see." 

###### v16 
Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" So there was division among them. 

###### v17 
Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet." 

###### v18 
The Jews therefore didn't believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, 

###### v19 
and asked them, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?" 

###### v20 
His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; 

###### v21 
but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself." 

###### v22 
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. 

###### v23 
Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him." 

###### v24 
So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner." 

###### v25 
He therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see." 

###### v26 
They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?" 

###### v27 
He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?" 

###### v28 
They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. 

###### v29 
We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from." 

###### v30 
The man answered them, "How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. 

###### v31 
We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him. 

###### v32 
Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind. 

###### v33 
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing." 

###### v34 
They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" Then they threw him out. 

###### v35 
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?" 

###### v36 
He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?" 

###### v37 
Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you." 

###### v38 
He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him. 

###### v39 
Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind." 

###### v40 
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?" 

###### v41 
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.
