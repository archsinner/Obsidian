###### v1 
"Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, is a thief and a robber. 

###### v2 
But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 

###### v3 
The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. 

###### v4 
Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. 

###### v5 
They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don't know the voice of strangers." 

###### v6 
Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what he was telling them. 

###### v7 
Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door. 

###### v8 
All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them. 

###### v9 
I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture. 

###### v10 
The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly. 

###### v11 
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 

###### v12 
He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. 

###### v13 
The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep. 

###### v14 
I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own; 

###### v15 
even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. 

###### v16 
I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. 

###### v17 
Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,  that I may take it again. 

###### v18 
No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father." 

###### v19 
Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words. 

###### v20 
Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?" 

###### v21 
Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?" 

###### v22 
It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem. 

###### v23 
It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch. 

###### v24 
The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." 

###### v25 
Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me. 

###### v26 
But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you. 

###### v27 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 

###### v28 
I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 

###### v29 
My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand. 

###### v30 
I and the Father are one." 

###### v31 
Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 

###### v32 
Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?" 

###### v33 
The Jews answered him, "We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God." 

###### v34 
Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?' 

###### v35 
If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken), 

###### v36 
do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?' 

###### v37 
If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me. 

###### v38 
But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father." 

###### v39 
They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand. 

###### v40 
He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there. 

###### v41 
Many came to him. They said, "John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true." 

###### v42 
Many believed in him there.
