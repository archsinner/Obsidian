###### v1 
Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. 

###### v2 
It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick. 

###### v3 
The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick." 

###### v4 
But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it." 

###### v5 
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 

###### v6 
When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. 

###### v7 
Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let's go into Judea again." 

###### v8 
The disciples asked him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you. Are you going there again?" 

###### v9 
Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 

###### v10 
But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn't in him." 

###### v11 
He said these things, and after that, he said to them, "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep." 

###### v12 
The disciples therefore said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover." 

###### v13 
Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep. 

###### v14 
So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead. 

###### v15 
I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to him." 

###### v16 
Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go also, that we may die with him." 

###### v17 
So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. 

###### v18 
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away. 

###### v19 
Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. 

###### v20 
Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house. 

###### v21 
Therefore Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died. 

###### v22 
Even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you." 

###### v23 
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again." 

###### v24 
Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." 

###### v25 
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies. 

###### v26 
Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?" 

###### v27 
She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world." 

###### v28 
When she had said this, she went away and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling you." 

###### v29 
When she heard this, she arose quickly and went to him. 

###### v30 
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. 

###### v31 
Then the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there." 

###### v32 
Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died." 

###### v33 
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 

###### v34 
and said, "Where have you laid him?" They told him, "Lord, come and see." 

###### v35 
Jesus wept. 

###### v36 
The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for him!" 

###### v37 
Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?" 

###### v38 
Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 

###### v39 
Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days." 

###### v40 
Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?" 

###### v41 
So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me. 

###### v42 
I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me." 

###### v43 
When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" 

###### v44 
He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go." 

###### v45 
Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him. 

###### v46 
But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done. 

###### v47 
The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we doing? For this man does many signs. 

###### v48 
If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation." 

###### v49 
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all, 

###### v50 
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish." 

###### v51 
Now he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 

###### v52 
and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. 

###### v53 
So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death. 

###### v54 
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples. 

###### v55 
Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves. 

###### v56 
Then they sought for Jesus and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't coming to the feast at all?" 

###### v57 
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.
