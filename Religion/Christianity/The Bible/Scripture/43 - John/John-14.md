###### v1 
"Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me. 

###### v2 
In my Father's house are many homes. If it weren't so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. 

###### v3 
If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also. 

###### v4 
You know where I go, and you know the way." 

###### v5 
Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?" 

###### v6 
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me. 

###### v7 
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him." 

###### v8 
Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us." 

###### v9 
Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, 'Show us the Father?' 

###### v10 
Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works. 

###### v11 
Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake. 

###### v12 
Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father. 

###### v13 
Whatever you will ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 

###### v14 
If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it. 

###### v15 
If you love me, keep my commandments. 

###### v16 
I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever: 

###### v17 
the Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive; for it doesn't see him and doesn't know him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you. 

###### v18 
I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you. 

###### v19 
Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also. 

###### v20 
In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. 

###### v21 
One who has my commandments and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him." 

###### v22 
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?" 

###### v23 
Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him. 

###### v24 
He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words. The word which you hear isn't mine, but the Father's who sent me. 

###### v25 
I have said these things to you while still living with you. 

###### v26 
But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you. 

###### v27 
Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Don't let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. 

###### v28 
You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said 'I am going to my Father;' for the Father is greater than I. 

###### v29 
Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens, you may believe. 

###### v30 
I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me. 

###### v31 
But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let's go from here.
