###### v1 
"I have said these things to you so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble. 

###### v2 
They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God. 

###### v3 
They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me. 

###### v4 
But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. 

###### v5 
But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' 

###### v6 
But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. 

###### v7 
Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. 

###### v8 
When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; 

###### v9 
about sin, because they don't believe in me; 

###### v10 
about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won't see me any more; 

###### v11 
about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. 

###### v12 
"I still have many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now. 

###### v13 
However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming. 

###### v14 
He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you. 

###### v15 
All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine and will declare it to you. 

###### v16 
A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me." 

###### v17 
Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?" 

###### v18 
They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while'? We don't know what he is saying." 

###### v19 
Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?' 

###### v20 
Most certainly I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 

###### v21 
A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn't remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world. 

###### v22 
Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. 

###### v23 
"In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. 

###### v24 
Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. 

###### v25 
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. 

###### v26 
In that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you that I will pray to the Father for you, 

###### v27 
for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. 

###### v28 
I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father." 

###### v29 
His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech. 

###### v30 
Now we know that you know all things, and don't need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God." 

###### v31 
Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? 

###### v32 
Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 

###### v33 
I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."
