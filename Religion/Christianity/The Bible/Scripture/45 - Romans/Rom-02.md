###### v1 
Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. 

###### v2 
We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. 

###### v3 
Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? 

###### v4 
Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? 

###### v5 
But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God; 

###### v6 
who "will pay back to everyone according to their works:" 

###### v7 
to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life; 

###### v8 
but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation, 

###### v9 
oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 

###### v10 
But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 

###### v11 
For there is no partiality with God. 

###### v12 
For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. 

###### v13 
For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified 

###### v14 
(for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves, 

###### v15 
in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them) 

###### v16 
in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ. 

###### v17 
Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God, 

###### v18 
know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, 

###### v19 
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, 

###### v20 
a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. 

###### v21 
You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal? 

###### v22 
You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 

###### v23 
You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law? 

###### v24 
For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,"  just as it is written. 

###### v25 
For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 

###### v26 
If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? 

###### v27 
Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? 

###### v28 
For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; 

###### v29 
but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
