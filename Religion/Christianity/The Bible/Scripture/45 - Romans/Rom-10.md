###### v1 
Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved. 

###### v2 
For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 

###### v3 
For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 

###### v4 
For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 

###### v5 
For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them." 

###### v6 
But the righteousness which is of faith says this, "Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down); 

###### v7 
or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)" 

###### v8 
But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith which we preach: 

###### v9 
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 

###### v10 
For with the heart, one believes resulting in righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made resulting in salvation. 

###### v11 
For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed." 

###### v12 
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him. 

###### v13 
For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved." 

###### v14 
How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher? 

###### v15 
And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!" 

###### v16 
But they didn't all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" 

###### v17 
So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 

###### v18 
But I say, didn't they hear? Yes, most certainly, "Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." 

###### v19 
But I ask, didn't Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation. I will make you angry with a nation void of understanding." 

###### v20 
Isaiah is very bold and says, "I was found by those who didn't seek me. I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me." 

###### v21 
But about Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
