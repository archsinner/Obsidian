###### v1 
I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 

###### v2 
God didn't reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel: 

###### v3 
"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life." 

###### v4 
But how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal." 

###### v5 
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 

###### v6 
And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. 

###### v7 
What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened. 

###### v8 
According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."  

###### v9 
David says, "Let their table be made a snare, a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them. 

###### v10 
Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Always keep their backs bent." 

###### v11 
I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. 

###### v12 
Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness? 

###### v13 
For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; 

###### v14 
if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them. 

###### v15 
For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead? 

###### v16 
If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches. 

###### v17 
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree, 

###### v18 
don't boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you. 

###### v19 
You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in." 

###### v20 
True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don't be conceited, but fear; 

###### v21 
for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. 

###### v22 
See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off. 

###### v23 
They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 

###### v24 
For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? 

###### v25 
For I don't desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, 

###### v26 
and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 

###### v27 
This is my covenant with them, when I will take away their sins." 

###### v28 
Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake. 

###### v29 
For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 

###### v30 
For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 

###### v31 
even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy. 

###### v32 
For God has bound all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all. 

###### v33 
Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! 

###### v34 
"For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?" 

###### v35 
"Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?" 

###### v36 
For of him, and through him, and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.
