###### v1 
Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service. 

###### v2 
Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. 

###### v3 
For I say through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith. 

###### v4 
For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function, 

###### v5 
so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another, 

###### v6 
having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy, let's prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; 

###### v7 
or service, let's give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching; 

###### v8 
or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 

###### v9 
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good. 

###### v10 
In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor preferring one another; 

###### v11 
not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 

###### v12 
rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer; 

###### v13 
contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality. 

###### v14 
Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse. 

###### v15 
Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep. 

###### v16 
Be of the same mind one toward another. Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits. 

###### v17 
Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men. 

###### v18 
If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men. 

###### v19 
Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."  

###### v20 
Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head." 

###### v21 
Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
