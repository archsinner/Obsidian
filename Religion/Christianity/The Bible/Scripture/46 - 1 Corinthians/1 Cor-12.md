###### v1 
Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant. 

###### v2 
You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led. 

###### v3 
Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit. 

###### v4 
Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. 

###### v5 
There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord. 

###### v6 
There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all. 

###### v7 
But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all. 

###### v8 
For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; 

###### v9 
to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit; 

###### v10 
and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages. 

###### v11 
But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires. 

###### v12 
For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. 

###### v13 
For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit. 

###### v14 
For the body is not one member, but many. 

###### v15 
If the foot would say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the body. 

###### v16 
If the ear would say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body," it's not therefore not part of the body. 

###### v17 
If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be? 

###### v18 
But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired. 

###### v19 
If they were all one member, where would the body be? 

###### v20 
But now they are many members, but one body. 

###### v21 
The eye can't tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you." 

###### v22 
No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. 

###### v23 
Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety; 

###### v24 
whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part, 

###### v25 
that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. 

###### v26 
When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. 

###### v27 
Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. 

###### v28 
God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages. 

###### v29 
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers? 

###### v30 
Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret? 

###### v31 
But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
