###### v1 
But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow. 

###### v2 
For if I make you grieve, then who will make me glad but he who is made to grieve by me? 

###### v3 
And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you. 

###### v4 
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made to grieve, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you. 

###### v5 
But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all. 

###### v6 
This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one; 

###### v7 
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow. 

###### v8 
Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him. 

###### v9 
For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things. 

###### v10 
Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, 

###### v11 
that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes. 

###### v12 
Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord, 

###### v13 
I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia. 

###### v14 
Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place. 

###### v15 
For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved and in those who perish: 

###### v16 
to the one a stench from death to death, to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? 

###### v17 
For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.
