###### v1 
But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all, 

###### v2 
but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father. 

###### v3 
So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world. 

###### v4 
But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law, 

###### v5 
that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as children. 

###### v6 
And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, "Abba, Father!" 

###### v7 
So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 

###### v8 
However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods. 

###### v9 
But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again? 

###### v10 
You observe days, months, seasons, and years. 

###### v11 
I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you. 

###### v12 
I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong, 

###### v13 
but you know that because of weakness in the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time. 

###### v14 
That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 

###### v15 
What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. 

###### v16 
So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? 

###### v17 
They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them. 

###### v18 
But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you. 

###### v19 
My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you-- 

###### v20 
but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you. 

###### v21 
Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law? 

###### v22 
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant, and one by the free woman. 

###### v23 
However, the son by the servant was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise. 

###### v24 
These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar. 

###### v25 
For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children. 

###### v26 
But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all. 

###### v27 
For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break out and shout, you who don't travail. For the desolate have more children than her who has a husband."  

###### v28 
Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 

###### v29 
But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. 

###### v30 
However what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not inherit with the son of the free woman." 

###### v31 
So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant, but of the free woman.
