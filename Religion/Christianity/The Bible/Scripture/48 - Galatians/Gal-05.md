###### v1 
Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 

###### v2 
Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. 

###### v3 
Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 

###### v4 
You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace. 

###### v5 
For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. 

###### v6 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love. 

###### v7 
You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth? 

###### v8 
This persuasion is not from him who calls you. 

###### v9 
A little yeast grows through the whole lump. 

###### v10 
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is. 

###### v11 
But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed. 

###### v12 
I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off. 

###### v13 
For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another. 

###### v14 
For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 

###### v15 
But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another. 

###### v16 
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh. 

###### v17 
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire. 

###### v18 
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 

###### v19 
Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness, 

###### v20 
idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies, 

###### v21 
envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God's Kingdom. 

###### v22 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 

###### v23 
gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 

###### v24 
Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. 

###### v25 
If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit. 

###### v26 
Let's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
