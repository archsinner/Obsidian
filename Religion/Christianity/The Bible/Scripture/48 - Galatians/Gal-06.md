###### v1 
Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted. 

###### v2 
Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 

###### v3 
For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 

###### v4 
But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else. 

###### v5 
For each man will bear his own burden. 

###### v6 
But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches. 

###### v7 
Don't be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 

###### v8 
For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 

###### v9 
Let's not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up. 

###### v10 
So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. 

###### v11 
See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand. 

###### v12 
As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised; just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 

###### v13 
For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh. 

###### v14 
But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 

###### v15 
For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 

###### v16 
As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel. 

###### v17 
From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. 

###### v18 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
