###### v1 
But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you. 

###### v2 
For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night. 

###### v3 
For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape. 

###### v4 
But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief. 

###### v5 
You are all children of light and children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness, 

###### v6 
so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober. 

###### v7 
For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night. 

###### v8 
But since we belong to the day, let's be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 

###### v9 
For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### v10 
who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 

###### v11 
Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do. 

###### v12 
But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, 

###### v13 
and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. 

###### v14 
We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all. 

###### v15 
See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all. 

###### v16 
Always rejoice. 

###### v17 
Pray without ceasing. 

###### v18 
In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you. 

###### v19 
Don't quench the Spirit. 

###### v20 
Don't despise prophecies. 

###### v21 
Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good. 

###### v22 
Abstain from every form of evil. 

###### v23 
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### v24 
He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it. 

###### v25 
Brothers, pray for us. 

###### v26 
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 

###### v27 
I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers. 

###### v28 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
