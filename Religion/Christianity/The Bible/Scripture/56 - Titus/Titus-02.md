In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,

For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 

###### v12 
instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; 

###### v13 
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, 

###### v14 
who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. 

###### v15 
Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.
