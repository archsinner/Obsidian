###### v1 
Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, 

###### v2 
to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. 

###### v3 
For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 

###### v4 
But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, 

###### v5 
not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 

###### v6 
whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior; 

###### v7 
that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

###### v8 
This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; 

###### v9 
but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 

###### v10 
Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, 

###### v11 
knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned. 

###### v12 
When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. 

###### v13 
Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. 

###### v14 
Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 

###### v15 
All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
