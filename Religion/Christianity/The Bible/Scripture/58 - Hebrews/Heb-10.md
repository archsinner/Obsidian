###### v1 
For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near. 

###### v2 
Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins? 

###### v3 
But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins. 

###### v4 
For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. 

###### v5 
Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, "You didn't desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. 

###### v6 
You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. 

###### v7 
Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'" 

###### v8 
Previously saying, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them" (those which are offered according to the law), 

###### v9 
then he has said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He takes away the first, that he may establish the second, 

###### v10 
by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 

###### v11 
Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and offering often the same sacrifices which can never take away sins, 

###### v12 
but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God, 

###### v13 
from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet. 

###### v14 
For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. 

###### v15 
The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying, 

###### v16 
"This is the covenant that I will make with them: 'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'" then he says, 

###### v17 
"I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more." 

###### v18 
Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. 

###### v19 
Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, 

###### v20 
by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, 

###### v21 
and having a great priest over God's house, 

###### v22 
let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water, 

###### v23 
let's hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful. 

###### v24 
Let's consider how to provoke one another to love and good works, 

###### v25 
not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching. 

###### v26 
For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, 

###### v27 
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries. 

###### v28 
A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 

###### v29 
How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? 

###### v30 
For we know him who said, "Vengeance belongs to me. I will repay," says the Lord. 

###### v31 
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 

###### v32 
But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings; 

###### v33 
partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so. 

###### v34 
For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens. 

###### v35 
Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward. 

###### v36 
For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise. 

###### v37 
"In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait. 

###### v38 
But the righteous will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him." 

###### v39 
But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.
