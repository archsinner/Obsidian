###### v1 
Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen. 

###### v2 
For by this, the elders obtained testimony. 

###### v3 
By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible. 

###### v4 
By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks. 

###### v5 
By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God. 

###### v6 
Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. 

###### v7 
By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

###### v11 
By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised. 

###### v12 
Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead. 

###### v13 
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 

###### v14 
For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 

###### v15 
If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return. 

###### v16 
But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. 

###### v17 
By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son, 

###### v18 
to whom it was said, "Your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac,"

###### v24 
By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 

###### v25 
choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time, 

###### v26 
considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward. 

###### v27 
By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 

###### v28 
By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. 

###### v29 
By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.

of whom the world was not worthy--wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth. 

###### v39 
These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise, 

###### v40 
God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
