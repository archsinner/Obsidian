###### v1 
The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth, 

###### v2 
for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: 

###### v3 
Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 

###### v4 
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. 

###### v5 
Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 

###### v6 
This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. 

###### v7 
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. 

###### v8 
Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. 

###### v9 
Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 

###### v10 
If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him, 

###### v11 
for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. 

###### v12 
Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. 

###### v13 
The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
